# in tag descriptions and add links for HTML output.  Each line of this file
# has three fields separated by double colons:

#     <section> :: <title> :: <url>
#
# If <section> is empty, that line specifies the title and URL for the whole
# manual.  If <url> is empty, that manual is not available on the web.
