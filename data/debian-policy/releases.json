Many thanks to Osamu Aoki and Guillem Jover for lots of\n    hard work on the conversion.  This was a huge conversion, so there\n    will probably be some lingering formatting issues, incorrect markup,\n    and less-than-ideal output.  Please report any problems as bugs.\n    (Closes: #175064, #700532, #809382)\n  * Additional fixes from Guillem Jover as part of the DocBook conversion:\n    - Stop distributing the source SGML files as part of the installed\n      package.  There doesn't seem to be any point in doing this.\n    - Switch to xsltproc and dblatex instead of OpenJade.\n    - Stop using tidy on the generated files since it generates larger\n      files and the output from xsltproc is already compliant and fairly\n      clean.\n    - Remove unused Build-Depends.\n    - Use entities instead of literal <, >, and & characters.\n    - Use <var> instead of escaped angle brackets for metavariables.\n    - Use <var> instead of <em> inside <tt>.\n    - Avoid slashes in section IDs.\n    - Convert a comment about maintenance policy in the Menu Policy\n      document to a regular paragraph in the document.\n    - Replace a comment reference to the policy maintenance process with\n      an actual link to Process.md.\n    - Remove obsolete SGML comments.\n  * Move the description of < and > relations to a footnote to make\n    abundantly clear that they're no longer valid relation operators in\n    dependencies.  (Closes: #816515)\n  * Clarify informative mentions of debian/tmp in the appendices to\n    document the now-common use of debian/<pkg> instead as the temporary\n    staging area.  Document that convention, instead of\n    debian/tmp-something, for multi-binary packages.  Thanks, Niels\n    Thykier.  (Closes: #816249)\n  * Remove lingering wording that implied that build-arch and build-indep\n    targets are optional.  Thanks, Ferenc Wagner, Jakub Wilk, and Charles\n    Plessy.  (Closes: #793999)\n  * Rather than giving the paths to the installed shlibs and symbols files\n    and then saying those paths shouldn't be used, just say to use\n    dpkg-query --control-show.  Recommend --control-show instead of\n    --control-path, since the latter is deprecated.  Patch from Salvatore\n    Bonaccorso.  (Closes: #688220)\n  * Explicitly give Unicode code points in the definition of the syntax of\n    Debian control files and, where appropriate, show the character.\n    Patch from Ben Finney.  (Closes: #821365)\n  * Remove obsolete footnote about a versioned dependency on a\n    liblockfile1 release from 1999.  Thanks, Jakub Wilk.  (Closes: #794902)\n  * Fix the long name of the Common Public License in the copyright-format\n    policy.  It is just Common Public License, with no leading \"IBM\".\n    Thanks, Stefano Zacchiroli.  (Closes: #781654)\n  * Fix the copyright-format examples to not have duplicate License\n    paragraphs.  Thanks, Stefan <bd@bc-bd.org>.  (Closes: #824922)\n  * Replace reference to dbus-launch in the autopkgtest documentation with\n    dbus-run-session.  Patch from Simon McVittie.  (Closes: #835876)\n  * Add an example of an architecture restriction in a dependency with\n    multiple architectures separated by spaces.  (Closes: #734662)\n  * Replace use of markdown with MultiMarkdown for the autopkgtest\n    documentation and convert README and Process to MultiMarkdown, thus\n    dropping the last org-mode files and the build dependency on Emacs.\n    Patch from Guillem Jover.  (Closes: #849483)\n  * Add some additional information to the upgrading-checklist entry for\n    the 3.9.8.0 release.\n  * Fix debian/changelog and upgrading-checklist dates for the 3.9.8.0\n    release to match the actual upload.  (Closes: #822059)\n  * Fix duplicated \"the\" words in 4.4 and 8.6.3.2.  Patch from Valentin\n    Samir.  (Closes: #830989)\n  * Clean up the upgrading checklist a bit:\n    - Rewrite the introduction to read a bit more smoothly and mention\n      that the Standards-Version value omits the minor patch number.\n    - Remove the minor patch number from all the version headings except\n      for the anomalies that contain normative changes, and note those\n      explicitly.\n    - Remove some unhelpful section headings and trailing colons in very\n      old upgrading checklist entries.\n    - Standardize the release date format.\n  * Compress all files with gzip -n to avoid embedding timestamps,\n    enabling reproducible builds.\n  * Redo some of the Makefile and debian/rules dependencies to avoid\n    ambiguous pattern rules and to ensure that make at the top level\n    rebuilds output files if input files change.\n  * Switch to https URLs for Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser.\n  * Use the same URL for both Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser, which now works\n    fine and has some advantages over the gitweb version for Vcs-Browser.\n    Thanks, Mattia Rizzolo.\n  * Run wrap-and-sort -ast.\n  * Tag as Multi-Arch: foreign (mostly to silence the hinter).\n\n  [ Sean Whitton ]\n  * Remove references to DebianDoc-SGML from README.md.\n  * Fix typo & comma splice in Process.md.",

Section 3.3 (\"Files\") should\n    become Section 4.  The Sections that are currently Section 4 and\n    Section 5 should be moved down to become Section 5 and Section 6\n    accordingly.\n\n    What is now Section 5.5 (\"Log files\") should be moved to be a\n    subsection of the new Section 4 (\"Files\"), becoming section 4.8,\n    placing it after \"Configuration files\", moving the would-be Section\n    4.8 (\"Permissions and owners\") to Section 4.9.  All subsections of the\n    current Section 5 after 5.5 should be accordingly moved down to fill\n    in the number gap.\n\n    This, along with the next amendment, justifies bumping up the version\n    number. closes: BUG#25911\n\n  * AMENDMENT: Added in changes in Bug #21185, about the naming and\n    compression of changelog files. Now, if the upstream changelog file is\n    HTML formatted, it should be accessible as\n    /usr/doc/<package>/changelog.html.gz It also allows for this to be a\n    symlink, if the upstream file name does not conform to Debian\n    conventions. closes: BUG#21185\n\n  * AMENDMENT: Added in changes in Bug #7890, to make clear that the HTML\n    documents should be supplied in _some_ package, not necessarily in the\n    main binary package (at the discretion of the maintainer).\n    closes: BUG#7890\n\n  * AMENDMENT: Added in changes in Bug #26461, which corrects the policy\n    to refer to /usr/doc/<package>/copyright, rather than\n    /usr/doc/copyright/<package>. closes: BUG#26461\n\n  * AMENDMENT: Added in changes in Bug #25385, which allow the\n    architecture specification strings to be of the form <arch>-<os>,\n    where os is one of linux, gnu. Previously, only linux was allowed, now\n    we also cater to the hurd. closes: BUG#25385\n\n  * The responsibility of the contents of this package has now passed to\n    the debian-policy mailing list. The packaging details are now being\n    managed by a group of maintainers that do ot won the contents.\n\n  * Make the package optional, not extra.\n\n  * Re did the SGML markup. Normalized the document, and undid the omitted\n    and shor tags. Personally, I use too many DTD's in real life to be so\n    converssant with each one to be clever with tag omissions, and, since\n    I have a smart editor, omitting tags does not byuy one much. In the\n    process, I discovered a few errors in the markup (one of my\n    predecessors hasd the unfortunate habit of treating <p> as a \"create\n    some space here\" tag, and more often than not put it at the end of a\n    paragraph, rather than using is as a container element (which is what\n    it is, really).\n\n  * Re did the control files, making them more robust\n\n  * re did the rules file, making it more general, and easier to maintain\n    by putting in a layer of abstractions.",
