=head1 NAME

Lintian::Relation - Lintian operations on dependencies and relationships

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $depends = Lintian::Relation->new('foo | bar, baz');
    print "yes\n" if $depends->implies('baz');
    print "no\n" if $depends->implies('foo');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides functions for parsing and evaluating package
relationship fields such as Depends and Recommends for binary packages and
Build-Depends for source packages.  It parses a relationship into an
internal format and can then answer questions such as "does this
dependency require that a given package be installed" or "is this
relationship a superset of another relationship."

A dependency line is viewed as a predicate formula.  The comma separator
means "and", and the alternatives separator means "or".  A bare package
name is the predicate "a package of this name is available".  A package
name with a version clause is the predicate "a package of this name that
satisfies this version clause is available."  Architecture restrictions,
as specified in Policy for build dependencies, are supported and also
checked in the implication logic unless the new_noarch() constructor is
used.  With that constructor, architecture restrictions are ignored.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item new(RELATION)

Creates a new Lintian::Relation object corresponding to the parsed
relationship RELATION.  This object can then be used to ask questions
about that relationship.  RELATION may be C<undef> or the empty string, in
which case the returned Lintian::Relation object is empty (always
satisfied).

=item new_norestriction(RELATION)

Creates a new Lintian::Relation object corresponding to the parsed
relationship RELATION, ignoring architecture restrictions and restriction
lists. This should be used in cases where we only care if a dependency is
present in some cases and we don't want to require that the architectures
match (such as when checking for proper build dependencies, since if there
are architecture constraints the maintainer is doing something beyond
Lintian's ability to analyze) or that the restrictions list match (Lintian
can't handle dependency implications with build profiles yet).  RELATION
may be C<undef> or the empty string, in which case the returned
Lintian::Relation object is empty (always satisfied).

=item new_noarch(RELATION)

An alias for new_norestriction.

=cut

*new_noarch = \&new_norestriction;

=item and(RELATION, ...)

Creates a new Lintian::Relation object produced by AND'ing all the
relations together.  Semantically it is the similar to:

 Lintian::Relation->new (join (', ', @relations))

Except it can avoid some overhead and it works if some of the elements
are Lintian::Relation objects already.

=item duplicates()

Returns a list of duplicated elements within the relation object.  Each
element of the returned list will be a reference to an anonymous array
holding a set of relations considered duplicates of each other.  Two
relations are considered duplicates if one implies the other, meaning that
if one relationship is satisfied, the other is necessarily satisfied.
This relationship does not have to be commutative: the opposite
implication may not hold.

=cut

    # dependencies.  We want foo (<< 2), foo (>> 1), foo (= 1.5) to end up as
    # one set of duplicates, even though the first doesn't imply the second.
    #
    # $dups holds a hash, where the key is the earliest dependency in a set
    # and the value is a hash whose keys are the other dependencies in the
    # set.  $seen holds a map from package names to the duplicate sets that
    # they're part of, if they're not the earliest package in a set.  If
    # either of the dependencies in a duplicate pair were already seen, add
    # the missing one of the pair to the existing set rather than creating a
    # new one.

object if it has no restrictions).

}

=item implies(RELATION)

Returns true if the relationship implies RELATION, meaning that if the
Lintian::Relation object is satisfied, RELATION will always be satisfied.
RELATION may be either a string or another Lintian::Relation object.

By default, architecture restrictions are honored in RELATION if it is a
string.  If architecture restrictions should be ignored in RELATION,
create a Lintian::Relation object with new_noarch() and pass that in as
RELATION instead of the string.

Returns true if the relationship implies that RELATION is certainly false,

be satisfied.  RELATION may be either a string or another

As with implies(), by default, architecture restrictions are honored in
RELATION if it is a string.  If architecture restrictions should be
ignored in RELATION, create a Lintian::Relation object with new_noarch()
and pass that in as RELATION instead of the string.

=item matches (REGEX[, WHAT])

Check if one of the predicates in this relation matches REGEX.  WHAT
determines what is tested against REGEX and if not given, defaults to
VISIT_PRED_NAME.

This method will return a truth value if REGEX matches at least one
predicate or clause (as defined by the WHAT parameter - see below).

NOTE: Often L</implies> (or L</implies_inverse>) is a better choice
than this method.  This method should generally only be used when
checking for a "pattern" package (e.g. phpapi-[\d\w+]+).


WHAT can be one of:

=over 4

=item VISIT_PRED_NAME

Match REGEX against the package name in each predicate (i.e. version
and architecture constrains are ignored).  Each predicate is tested in
isolation.  As an example:

 my $rel = Lintian::Relation->new ('somepkg | pkg-0 (>= 1)');
 # Will match (version is ignored)
 $rel->matches (qr/^pkg-\d$/, VISIT_PRED_NAME);

=item VISIT_PRED_FULL

Match REGEX against the full (normalized) predicate (i.e. including
version and architecture).  Each predicate is tested in isolation.
As an example:

 my $vrel = Lintian::Relation->new ('somepkg | pkg-0 (>= 1)');
 my $uvrel = Lintian::Relation->new ('somepkg | pkg-0');

 # Will NOT match (does not match with version)
 $vrel->matches (qr/^pkg-\d$/, VISIT_PRED_FULL);
 # Will match (this relation does not have a version)
 $uvrel->matches (qr/^pkg-\d$/, VISIT_PRED_FULL);

 # Will match (but only because there is a version)
 $vrel->matches (qr/^pkg-\d \(.*\)$/, VISIT_PRED_FULL);
 # Will NOT match (there is no version in the relation)
 $uvrel->matches (qr/^pkg-\d  \(.*\)$/, VISIT_PRED_FULL);

=item VISIT_OR_CLAUSE_FULL

Match REGEX against the full (normalized) OR clause.  Each predicate
will have both version and architecture constrains present.  As an
example:


 my $vpred = Lintian::Relation->new ('pkg-0 (>= 1)');
 my $orrel = Lintian::Relation->new ('somepkg | pkg-0 (>= 1)');
 my $rorrel = Lintian::Relation->new ('pkg-0 (>= 1) | somepkg');

 # Will match
 $vrel->matches (qr/^pkg-\d(?: \([^\)]\))?$/, VISIT_OR_CLAUSE_FULL);
 # These Will NOT match (does not match the "|" and the "somepkg" part)
 $orrel->matches (qr/^pkg-\d(?: \([^\)]\))?$/, VISIT_OR_CLAUSE_FULL);
 $rorrel->matches (qr/^pkg-\d(?: \([^\)]\))?$/, VISIT_OR_CLAUSE_FULL);

}

=item visit (CODE[, FLAGS])

Visit clauses or predicates of this relation.  Each clause or
predicate is passed to CODE as first argument and will be available as
C<$_>.

The optional bitmask parameter, FLAGS, can be used to control what is
visited and such.  If FLAGS is not given, it defaults to
VISIT_PRED_NAME.  The possible values of FLAGS are:

=over 4

=item VISIT_PRED_NAME

The package name in each predicate is visited, but the version and
architecture part(s) are left out (if any).

=item VISIT_PRED_FULL

The full predicates are visited in turn.  The predicate will be
normalized (by L</unparse>).

=item VISIT_OR_CLAUSE_FULL

CODE will be passed the full OR clauses of this relation.  The clauses
will be normalized (by L</unparse>)

Note: It will not visit the underlying predicates in the clause.

=item VISIT_STOP_FIRST_MATCH

Stop the visits the first time CODE returns a truth value.  This is
similar to L<first|List::Util/first>, except visit will return the
value returned by CODE.

=back

Except where a given flag specifies otherwise, the return value of
visit is last value returned by CODE (or C<undef> for the empty
relation).
