=head1 NAME

Lintian::SlidingWindow - Lintian interface to sliding window match

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Lintian::SlidingWindow;

    my $sfd = Lintian::SlidingWindow->new('<','someevilfile.c', sub { $_ = lc($_); });
    my $window;
    while ($window = $sfd->readwindow) {
       if (index($window, 'evil') > -1) {
           if($window =~
                 m/software \s++ shall \s++
                   be \s++ used \s++ for \s++ good \s*+ ,?+ \s*+
                   not \s++ evil/xsim) {
              # do something like : tag 'license-problem-json-evil';
           }
       }
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lintian::SlidingWindow provides a way of matching some pattern,
including multi line pattern, without needing to fully load the
file in memory.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item new(HANDLE[, BLOCKSUB[, BLOCKSIZE]])

Create a new sliding window by reading from a given HANDLE, which must
be open for reading. Optionally run BLOCKSUB against each block. Note
that BLOCKSUB should apply transform byte by byte and does not depend
of context.

Each window consists of up to two blocks of BLOCKSIZE characters.

=back

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item readwindow

Return a new block of sliding window. Return undef at end of file.

=item blocknumber

return the number of block read by the instance. Return undef if no block has been read.
