=head1 NAME

Lintian::Data::Architectures -- Lintian API for handling architectures and wildcards

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Lintian::Data::Architectures;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lintian API for checking and expanding architectures and architecture
wildcards.  The functions are backed by a L<data|Lintian::Data> file,
so it may be out of date (use private/refresh-archs to update it).

Generally all architecture names are in the format "$os-$architecture" and
wildcards are "$os-any" or "any-$cpu", though there are exceptions:

Note that the architecture and cpu name are not always identical
(example architecture "armhf" has cpu name "arm").

=item is_wildcard ($wildcard)

Returns a truth value if $wildcard is a known architecture wildcard.

Note: 'any' is considered a wildcard and not an architecture.

=cut

sub is_wildcard {
    my ($self, $wildcard) = @_;

    return exists $self->wildcards->{$wildcard};
}

=item is_release_architecture ($architecture)

Returns a truth value if $architecture is (an alias of) a Debian machine
architecture.  It returns a false value for
architecture wildcards (including "any") and unknown architectures.

=cut

sub is_release_architecture {
    my ($self, $architecture) = @_;

    return exists $self->names->{$architecture};
}

=item expand_wildcard ($wildcard)

Returns a list of architectures that this wildcard expands to.  No
order is guaranteed (even between calls).  Returned values must not be
modified.

Note: This list is based on the architectures in Lintian's data file.
However, many of these are not supported or used in Debian or any of
its derivatives.

The returned values matches the list generated by dpkg-architecture -L,
so the returned list may use (e.g.) "amd64" for "linux-amd64".

=cut

sub expand_wildcard {
    my ($self, $wildcard) = @_;

    return keys %{ $self->wildcards->{$wildcard} // {} };
}

=item wildcard_includes ($wildcard, $architecture)

Returns a truth value if $architecture is included in the list of
architectures that $wildcard expands to.

This is generally faster than

  grep { $_ eq $architecture } expand_arch_wildcard ($wildcard)

It also properly handles cases like "linux-amd64" and "amd64" being
aliases.

=cut

sub wildcard_includes {
    my ($self, $wildcard, $architecture) = @_;
