package Lintian::Reporting::Util;

=head1 NAME

Lintian::Reporting::Util - Lintian utility functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Lintian::Reporting::Util qw(load_state_cache find_backlog);

 my $cache = load_state_cache('path/to/state-dir');
 my @backlog = find_backlog('2.12', $cache);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains a number of utility subs that are nice to have
for the reporting framework, but on their own did not warrant their
own module.

Most subs are imported only on request.

=item find_backlog(LINTIAN_VERSION, STATE)

[Reporting tools only] Given the current lintian version and the
harness state, return a list of group ids that are part of the
backlog.  The list is sorted based on what version of Lintian
processed the package.

Note the result is by design not deterministic to reduce the
risk of all large packages being in the same run (e.g. like
gcc-5 + gcc-5-cross + gcc-6 + gcc-6-cross).
