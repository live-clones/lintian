=head1 NAME

Lintian::Processable::Binary::Class - Lintian interface to binary package data collection

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my ($name, $type, $dir) = ('foobar', 'binary', '/path/to/lab-entry');
    my $collect = Lintian::Processable::Binary::Class->new($name);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lintian::Processable::Binary::Class provides an interface to package data for binary
packages.  It implements data collection methods specific to binary
packages.

This module is in its infancy.  Most of Lintian still reads all data from
files in the laboratory whenever that data is needed and generates that
data via collect scripts.  The goal is to eventually access all data about
binary packages via this module so that the module can cache data where
appropriate and possibly retire collect scripts in favor of caching that
data in memory.

Native heuristics are only available in source packages.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item is_pkg_class ([TYPE])

Returns a truth value if the package is the given TYPE of special
package.  TYPE can be one of "transitional", "debug" or "any-meta".
If omitted it defaults to "any-meta".  The semantics for these values
are:

=over 4

=item transitional

The package is (probably) a transitional package (e.g. it is probably
empty, just depend on stuff will eventually disappear.)

Guessed from package description.

=item any-meta

This package is (probably) some kind of meta or task package.  A meta
package is usually empty and just depend on stuff.  It will also
return a truth value for "tasks" (i.e. tasksel "tasks").

A transitional package will also match this.

Guessed from package description, section or package name.

=item debug

The package is (probably) a package containing debug symbols.

Guessed from the package name.

=item auto-generated

The package is (probably) a package generated automatically (e.g. a
dbgsym package)

Guessed from the "Auto-Built-Package" field.
