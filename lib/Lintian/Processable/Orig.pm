=head1 NAME

Lintian::Processable::Orig - access to collected data about the upstream (orig) sources

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Lintian::Processable;
    my $processable = Lintian::Processable::Binary->new;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lintian::Processable::Orig provides an interface to collected data about the upstream (orig) sources.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item orig

Returns the index for orig.tar.gz.

=cut

has orig => (
    is => 'rw',
    lazy => 1,
    default => sub {
        return Lintian::Index::Orig->new;
    });

=item orig_index (FILE)

Like L</index> except orig_index is based on the "orig tarballs" of
the source packages.

For native packages L</index> and L</orig_index> are generally
identical.

NB: If sorted_index includes a debian packaging, it is was
contained in upstream part of the source package (or the package is
native).

=cut

sub orig_index {
    my ($self, $file) = @_;

    return $self->orig->lookup($file);
}

=item sorted_orig_index

=cut

sub sorted_orig_index {
    my ($self) = @_;

    return $self->orig->sorted_list;
}

=item orig_index_resolved_path(PATH)

Resolve PATH (relative to the root of the package) and return the
L<entry|Lintian::Index::Item> denoting the resolved path.

The resolution is done using
L<resolve_path|Lintian::Index::Item/resolve_path([PATH])>.

NB: If orig_index_resolved_path includes a debian packaging, it is was
contained in upstream part of the source package (or the package is
native).

=cut

sub orig_index_resolved_path {
    my ($self, $path) = @_;

    return $self->orig->resolve_path($path);
}
