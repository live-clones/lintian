=head1 NAME

Lintian::Processable::Installable - Lintian interface to binary package data collection

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my ($name, $type, $dir) = ('foobar', 'binary', '/path/to/lab-entry');
    my $collect = Lintian::Processable::Installable->new($name);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lintian::Processable::Installable provides an interface to package data for binary
packages.  It implements data collection methods specific to binary
packages.

This module is in its infancy.  Most of Lintian still reads all data from
files in the laboratory whenever that data is needed and generates that
data via collect scripts.  The goal is to eventually access all data about
binary packages via this module so that the module can cache data where
appropriate and possibly retire collect scripts in favor of caching that
data in memory.

Native heuristics are only available in source packages.
