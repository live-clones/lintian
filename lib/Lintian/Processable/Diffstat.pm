=head1 NAME

Lintian::Processable::Diffstat - access to collected diffstat data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Lintian::Processable;
    my $processable = Lintian::Processable::Binary->new;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lintian::Processable::Diffstat provides an interface to diffstat data.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item diffstat

Returns the path to diffstat output run on the Debian packaging diff
(a.k.a. the "diff.gz") for 1.0 non-native packages.  For source
packages without a "diff.gz" component, this returns the path to an
empty file (this may be a device like /dev/null).

=item saved_diffstat

Returns the cached diffstat information.
