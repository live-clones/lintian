=head1 NAME

Lintian::Processable::Installed - access to collected data about the upstream (orig) sources

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Lintian::Processable;
    my $processable = Lintian::Processable::Binary->new;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lintian::Processable::Installed provides an interface to collected data about the upstream (orig) sources.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item installed

Returns a index object representing installed files from a binary package.

=cut

has installed => (is => 'rw');

=item index (FILE)

Returns a L<path object|Lintian::File::Path> to FILE in the package.  FILE
must be relative to the root of the unpacked package and must be
without leading slash (or "./").  If FILE is not in the package, it
returns C<undef>.  If FILE is supposed to be a directory, it must be
given with a trailing slash.  Example:

  my $file = $info->index ("usr/bin/lintian");
  my $dir = $info->index ("usr/bin/");

To get a list of entries in the package, see L</sorted_index>.  To
actually access the underlying file (e.g. the contents), use
L</unpacked ([FILE])>.

Note that the "root directory" (denoted by the empty string) will
always be present, even if the underlying tarball omits it.

Needs-Info requirements for using I<index>: unpacked

=cut

sub index {
    my ($self, $file) = @_;

    return $self->installed->lookup($file);
}

=item sorted_index

Returns a sorted array of file names listed in the package.  The names
will not have a leading slash (or "./") and can be passed to
L</unpacked ([FILE])> or L</index (FILE)> as is.

The array will not contain the entry for the "root" of the package.

NB: For source packages, please see the
L<"index"-caveat|Lintian::Collect::Source/index (FILE)>.

Needs-Info requirements for using I<sorted_index>: L<Same as index|/index (FILE)>

=cut

sub sorted_index {
    my ($self) = @_;

    return $self->installed->sorted_list;
}

=item index_resolved_path(PATH)

Resolve PATH (relative to the root of the package) and return the
L<entry|Lintian::File::Path> denoting the resolved path.

The resolution is done using
L<resolve_path|Lintian::File::Path/resolve_path([PATH])>.

NB: For source packages, please see the
L<"index"-caveat|Lintian::Collect::Source/index (FILE)>.

Needs-Info requirements for using I<index_resolved_path>: L<Same as index|/index (FILE)>

=cut

sub index_resolved_path {
    my ($self, $path) = @_;

    return $self->installed->resolve_path($path);
}
