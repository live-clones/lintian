Lintian::Processable::Overrides - access to override data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Lintian::Processable;
    my $processable = Lintian::Processable::Binary->new;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lintian::Processable::Overrides provides an interface to package data for overrides.

=item overrides(OVERRIDE-FILE)

Read OVERRIDE-FILE and add the overrides found there which match the
metadata of the current file (package and type).  The overrides are added
to the overrides hash in the info hash entry for the current file.

file_start() must be called before this method.  This method throws an
exception if there is no current file and calls fail() if the override
file cannot be opened.
