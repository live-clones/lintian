=head1 NAME

Lintian::Processable::Control - access to collected control file data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Lintian::Processable;
    my $processable = Lintian::Processable::Binary->new;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lintian::Processable::Control provides an interface to control file data.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item control

Returns the index for a binary control file.

=cut

has control => (
    is => 'rw',
    lazy => 1,
    default => sub {
        return Lintian::Index::Control->new;
    });

=item control_index (FILE)

Returns a L<path object|Lintian::Index::Item> to FILE in the control.tar.gz.
FILE must be relative to the root of the control.tar.gz and must be
without leading slash (or "./").  If FILE is not in the
control.tar.gz, it returns C<undef>.

To get a list of entries in the control.tar.gz, see
L</sorted_control_index>.  To actually access the underlying file
(e.g. the contents), use L</control ([FILE])>.

Note that the "root directory" (denoted by the empty string) will
always be present, even if the underlying tarball omits it.

Needs-Info requirements for using I<control_index>: bin-pkg-control

=cut

sub control_index {
    my ($self, $file) = @_;

    return $self->control->lookup($file);
}

=item sorted_control_index

Returns a sorted array of file names listed in the control.tar.gz.
The names will not have a leading slash (or "./") and can be passed
to L</control ([FILE])> or L</control_index (FILE)> as is.

The array will not contain the entry for the "root" of the
control.tar.gz.

Needs-Info requirements for using I<sorted_control_index>: L<Same as control_index|/control_index (FILE)>

=cut

sub sorted_control_index {
    my ($self) = @_;

    return $self->control->sorted_list;
}

=item control_index_resolved_path(PATH)

Resolve PATH (relative to the root of the package) and return the
L<entry|Lintian::Index::Item> denoting the resolved path.

The resolution is done using
L<resolve_path|Lintian::Index::Item/resolve_path([PATH])>.

Needs-Info requirements for using I<control_index_resolved_path>: L<Same as control_index|/control_index (FILE)>

=cut

sub control_index_resolved_path {
    my ($self, $path) = @_;

    return $self->control->resolve_path($path);
}
