=head1 NAME

Lintian::Conffiles - access to collected control data for conffiles

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Lintian::Processable;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lintian::Conffiles provides an interface to control data for conffiles.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item instructions

=cut

has instructions => (is => 'rw', default => sub { {} });

=item parse

=cut

sub parse {
    my ($self, $file, $processable) = @_;

    return
      unless $file && $file->is_valid_utf8;

    my @lines = split($NEWLINE, $file->decoded_utf8);

    # dpkg strips whitespace (using isspace) from the right hand
    # side of the file name.

    # trim right
    s/\s+$// for @lines;

    my $position = 1;
    for my $line (@lines) {

        next
          unless length $line;

        my @words = split($SPACE, $line);
        my $path = pop @words;

        # path must be absolute
        if ($path !~ s{^/}{}) {
            $processable->hint('relative-conffile', $path, "(line $position)");
        }

        my $lc = List::Compare->new(\@words, \@KNOWN_INSTRUCTIONS);
        $processable->hint('unknown-conffile-instruction',
            $_,"(line $position)")
          for $lc->get_Lonly;

        if (exists $self->instructions->{$path}) {
            $processable->hint('duplicate-conffile', $path,"(line $position)");
            next;
        }

        $self->instructions->{$path} = \@words;

    } continue {
        ++$position;
    }

    return;
}

=item all

Returns a list of absolute filenames found for conffiles.

=cut

sub all {
    my ($self) = @_;

    return keys %{$self->instructions};
}

=item is_known (FILE)

Returns a truth value if FILE is listed in the conffiles control file.
If the control file is not present or FILE is not listed in it, it
returns C<undef>.

Note that FILE should be the filename relative to the package root
(even though the control file uses absolute paths).  If the control
file does relative paths, they are assumed to be relative to the
package root as well (and used without warning).

=cut

sub is_known {
    my ($self, $relative) = @_;

    return 1
      if exists $self->instructions->{$relative};

    return 0;
}
