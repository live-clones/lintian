Severity: error
Check: conffiles
See-Also: policy 10.7.2
Explanation: All configuration files must reside in <tt>/etc</tt>. Files below
 <tt>/usr</tt> may not be marked as conffiles since <tt>/usr</tt> might be
 mounted read-only. The local system administrator would therefore not
 have a chance to modify this configuration file.
