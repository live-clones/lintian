Tag: incorrect-libdir-in-la-file
Severity: error
Check: shared-libs
Info: The given .la file points to a libdir other than the path where it is
 installed. This can be caused by resetting <tt>prefix</tt> at make install
 time instead of using <tt>DESTDIR</tt>. The incorrect path will cause
 packages linking to this library using libtool to build incorrectly (adding
 incorrect paths to RPATH, for example).
