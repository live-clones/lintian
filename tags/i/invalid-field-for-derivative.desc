     are otherwise modified by the derivative.
   - The original maintainer is still credited for their work (eg. in a
     <tt>XSBC-Original-Maintainer</tt> fied.
   - References to revision control systems (eg. <tt>Vcs-Git</tt>) are
     pointing to the correct, updated location.
   - Fields that become misleading in the context of a derivative are
     removed.
