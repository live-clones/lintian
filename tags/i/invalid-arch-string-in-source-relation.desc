Severity: error
Check: fields/package-relations
Ref: policy 5.6.8
Info: The architecture string in the source relation includes an unknown
 architecture. This may be a typo, or it may be an architecture that dpkg
 doesn't know about yet. A common problem is incorrectly separating
 architectures with a comma, such as <tt>[i386, m68k]</tt>. Architectures
 are separated by spaces; this should instead be <tt>[i386 m68k]</tt>.
