Info: This <tt>/etc/init.d</tt> script does not have an LSB keyword
 section (or the <tt>### BEGIN INIT INFO</tt> tag is incorrect). This
 section provides description and runlevel information in a standard
 format and provides dependency information that can be used to
 parallelize the boot process. Please consider adding it.
