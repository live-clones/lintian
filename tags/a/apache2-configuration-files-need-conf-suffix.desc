Tag: apache2-configuration-files-need-conf-suffix
Severity: error
Check: apache2
Info: The package is installing an Apache2 configuration but that file does not
 end with a '<tt>.conf</tt>' suffix. Starting with Apache2 2.4 all configuration
 files except module '<tt>.load</tt>' files need that suffix or are ignored otherwise.
