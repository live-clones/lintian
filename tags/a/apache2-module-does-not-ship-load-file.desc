Tag: apache2-module-does-not-ship-load-file
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The package is an Apache2 HTTPD server module but does not ship a
 "<tt>.load</tt>" file or it was installed under an unexpected name. The load
 files in "<tt>/etc/apache2/mods-available</tt>" are required to interact with
 the server package to enable and disable the module and must match the module
 name without "<tt>mod_</tt> prefix, e.g. <tt>mod_foo</tt> must ship a load file
 named "<tt>foo.load</tt>".
