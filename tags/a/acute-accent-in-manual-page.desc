Info: This manual page uses the \' groff sequence. Usually, the
 intent to generate an apostrophe, but that sequence actually
 renders as an acute accent.
 .
 For an apostrophe or a single closing quote, use plain <tt>'</tt>.
 For single opening quote, i.e. a straight downward line <tt>'</tt>
 like the one used in shell commands, use <tt>'&#92;(aq'</tt>.
