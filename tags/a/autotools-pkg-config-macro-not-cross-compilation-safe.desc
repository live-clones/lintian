Tag: autotools-pkg-config-macro-not-cross-compilation-safe
Severity: warning
Check: cruft
Info: The package appears to use <tt>AC_PATH_PROG</tt> to discover the
 location of <tt>pkg-config(1)</tt>. This macro fails to select the correct
 version to support cross-compilation.
 .
 A better way would be to use the <tt>PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG</tt> macro from
 <tt>pkg.m4</tt> and then using the <tt>$PKG_CONFIG</tt> shell variable.
