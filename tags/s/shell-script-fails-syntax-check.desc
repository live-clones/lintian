Tag: shell-script-fails-syntax-check
Severity: error
Check: scripts
Info: Running this shell script with the shell's -n option set fails,
 which means that the script has syntax errors. The most common cause of
 this problem is a script expecting <tt>/bin/sh</tt> to be bash checked on
 a system using dash as <tt>/bin/sh</tt>.
 .
 Run e.g. <tt>sh -n yourscript</tt> to see the errors yourself.
 .
 Note this can have false-positives, for an example with bash scripts
 using "extglob".
