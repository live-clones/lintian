Tag: silent-on-rules-requiring-root
Severity: pedantic
Check: debian/control
Renamed-From:
 rules-requires-root-missing
Info: The <tt>debian/control</tt> file is missing an explicit
 <tt>Rules-Requires-Root</tt> field.
 .
 Traditionally, Debian packages have required root privileges for some
 debian/rules target requiring a split between build and binary targets.
 This makes the builds slower due to the increased amount of invocations
 as well as the overhead of fakeroot itself.
 .
 Please specify (eg.) <tt>Rules-Requires-Root: no</tt> in the
 <tt>debian/control</tt> source stanza, but packagers should
 verify using <tt>diffoscope(1)</tt> that the binaries built with this
 field present are identical.
