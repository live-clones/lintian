Tag: spelling-error-in-copyright
Severity: pedantic
Check: debian/copyright
Explanation: Lintian found a spelling error in the copyright file. Lintian has a
 list of common misspellings that it looks for. It does not have a
 dictionary like a spelling checker does. If this is a spelling error in
 the upstream license, in supporting email messages, or a case of Lintian
 being confused by non-English text, add an override.
