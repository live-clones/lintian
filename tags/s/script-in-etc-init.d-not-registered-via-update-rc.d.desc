Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: The package installs an <tt>/etc/init.d</tt> script which is
 not registered in the <tt>postinst</tt> script. This is usually a bug
 (such as omitting the <tt>#DEBHELPER#</tt> token) unless you omit the links
 intentionally for some reason or create the links some other way.
