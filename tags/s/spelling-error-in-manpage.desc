 If the string containing the spelling error is translated with the help
 of gettext (with the help of po4a, for example) or a similar tool,
 please fix the error in the translations as well as the English text to
 avoid making the translations fuzzy. With gettext, for example, this
 means you should also fix the spelling mistake in the corresponding
 msgids in the *.po files.
