Explanation: The upstream source contains a CVS directory. It was most likely
 included by accident since CVS directories usually don't belong in
 releases. When packaging a CVS snapshot, export from CVS rather than use
 a checkout. If an upstream release tarball contains CVS directories, you
 usually should report this as a bug to upstream.
