Severity: minor
Certainty: certain
Check: files
Info: This symlink contains two successive slashes (//). This is in violation
 of policy, where it is stated that symlinks should be as short as possible

 If you use debhelper, running dh_link after creating the package structure
 will fix this problem for you.
