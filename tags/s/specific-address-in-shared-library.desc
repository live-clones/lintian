Severity: error
Check: shared-libs
See-Also: policy 10.2
Renamed-From: shlib-with-non-pic-code
Explanation: The listed shared libraries contain object code that was compiled 
 without -fPIC. All object code in shared libraries should be recompiled
 separately from the static libraries with the -fPIC option. 
 .
 Another common mistake that causes this problem is linking with 
 <tt>gcc -Wl,-shared</tt> instead of <tt>gcc -shared</tt>.
 .
 In some cases, exceptions to this rule are warranted. If this is such a
 case, follow the procedure outlined in Policy and then please document
 the exception by adding a Lintian override to this package.
 .
 To check whether a shared library has this problem, run <tt>readelf
 -d</tt> on the shared library. If a tag of type TEXTREL is present, the
 shared library contains non-PIC code.
