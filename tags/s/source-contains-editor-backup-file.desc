Severity: warning
Check: cruft
Info: The Debian diff or native package contains a file ending in
 <tt>~</tt> or of the form <tt>.xxx.swp</tt>, which is normally either an
 Emacs or vim backup file or a backup file created by programs such as
 <tt>autoheader</tt> or <tt>debconf-updatepo</tt>. This usually causes no
 harm, but it's messy and bloats the size of the Debian diff to no useful
 purpose.
