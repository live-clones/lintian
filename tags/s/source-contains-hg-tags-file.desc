Severity: pedantic
Check: cruft
Info: The upstream source contains an <tt>.hgtags</tt> file. This file is
 Mercurial metadata that should normally not be distributed. It stores
 hashes of tagged commits in a Mercurial repository and isn't therefore
 useful without the repository. You may want to report this as an
 upstream bug.
