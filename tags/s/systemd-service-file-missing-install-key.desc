Tag: systemd-service-file-missing-install-key
Severity: info
Check: systemd
Info: The systemd service file does not contain a <tt>WantedBy=</tt> or
 <tt>RequiredBy=</tt> key in its <tt>[Install]</tt> section.
 .
 Forgetting to add such a line (e.g. <tt>WantedBy=multi-user.target</tt>)
 results in the service file not being started by default.
