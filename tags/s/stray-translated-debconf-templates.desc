Severity: warning

Info: This package contains a file named *templates.XX or
 *templates.XX_XX. This was the naming convention for the translated
 templates merged using debconf-mergetemplate. Since the package is using
 po-debconf, these files should be replaced by language-specific files in
 the <tt>debian/po</tt> directory and should no longer be needed.
