Explanation: The extended description (the lines after the first line of the
 "Description:" field) is only one or two lines long. The extended
 description should provide a user with enough information to decide
 whether they want to install this package, what it contains, and how it
 compares to similar packages. One or two lines is normally not enough to
 do this.
