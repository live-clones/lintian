Tag: example-interpreter-in-usr-local
Severity: pedantic
Check: scripts
Explanation: This package contains an example script that looks for an
 interpreter in a directory in /usr/local. Since Debian does not install
 anything in /usr/local, the example script would probably need
 modifications before a user could run it.
