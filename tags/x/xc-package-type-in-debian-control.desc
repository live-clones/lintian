Tag: xc-package-type-in-debian-control
Severity: pedantic
Check: debian/control
Explanation: The <tt>debian/control</tt> file contains an XC-Package-Type field.
 As of dpkg-dev 1.15.7, the dpkg development utilities recognize
 Package-Type as an official field name and do not add it to binary
 packages (the previous concern with the dpkg-dev-supported Package-Type
 field). XC-Package-Type should generally now be replaced with
 Package-Type.
