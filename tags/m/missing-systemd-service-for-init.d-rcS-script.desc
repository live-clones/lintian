Explanation: The rcS init.d script has no systemd equivalent.
 .
 Systemd has a SysV init.d script compatibility mode. It provides access to
 each SysV init.d script as long as there is no native service file with the
 same name (e.g. <tt>/lib/systemd/system/rsyslog.service</tt> corresponds to
 <tt>/etc/init.d/rsyslog</tt>).
 .
 Services in rcS.d are particularly problematic, because they often cause
 dependency loops, as they are ordered very early in the boot sequence.
