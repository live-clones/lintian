Tag: missing-dependency-on-numpy-abi
Severity: serious
Certainty: possible
Check: binaries
Info: This package includes a Python extension module, which uses Numpy via its
 binary interface. Such packages must depend on python-numpy-abi<i>N</i>.

 If the package is using debhelper, this problem is usually due to a
 missing dh_numpy (or dh_numpy3) call in <tt>debian/rules</tt>.
