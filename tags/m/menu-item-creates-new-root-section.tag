Tag: menu-item-creates-new-root-section
Severity: error
Check: menu-format
Explanation: The menu item has a line that specifies a new section to put a menu
 entry in, and this section appears right in the root menu. This is
 almost certainly an error. No new sections should be added to the root
 menu without discussion with the author of menu.
