Tag: menu-icon-cannot-be-parsed
Severity: warning
Check: menu-format
Explanation: The icon file could not be parsed. Perhaps this means a bad XPM file,
 or perhaps it means the Lintian parsing needs to be improved. If the
 window managers and standard tools accept the file then probably it's the
 latter; please file a bug on Lintian then.
