Explanation: The Python-Version or Python3-Version control field is not in one
 of the valid formats. It should be in one of the following:
 .
     all
     current
     current, &gt;= X.Y
     &gt;= X.Y
     &gt;= A.B, &lt;&lt; X.Y
     A.B, X.Y
 .
 (One or more specific versions may be listed with the last form.) A.B
 and X.Y should be Python versions.
