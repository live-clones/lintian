Tag: more-than-one-patch-system
Severity: warning
Check: patch-systems
Info: Either the build-dependencies list more than one patch system or the
 package uses the <tt>3.0 (quilt)</tt> source format but also has a
 dependency on <tt>dpatch</tt>. It's unlikely that you need both patch
 systems at the same time, and having multiple patch systems in play
 simultaneously can make understanding and modifying the source package
 unnecessarily complex.
