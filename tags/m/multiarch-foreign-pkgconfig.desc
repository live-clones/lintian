Tag: multiarch-foreign-pkgconfig
Severity: error
Check: files/multi-arch
Info: The package is architecture-dependent, ships a pkg-config file in a
 public, architecture-dependent pkg-config search path and is marked
 <tt>Multi-Arch: foreign</tt>. pkg-config will be unable to find this file,
 unless it is installed for a matching architecture, but the <tt>foreign</tt>
 marking says that the architecture should not matter.
 .
 Please remove the <tt>Multi-Arch: foreign</tt> stanza.
