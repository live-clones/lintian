Severity: warning
Check: menu-format
Explanation: The menu item has a line that specifies an unknown section or uses a
 section that is intended only as a menu root, not as a section that
 applications should use directly. Check the spelling of the section and
 check the section against the list in the menu policy. (The menu
 sections changed as of June of 2007.)
