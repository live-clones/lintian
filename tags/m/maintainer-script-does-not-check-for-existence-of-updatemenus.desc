Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: The maintainer script calls the <tt>update-menus</tt> command without
 checking for existence first. (The <tt>menu</tt> package which provides the
 command is not marked as "essential" package.)
 .
 For example, use the following code in your maintainer script:
 .
  if which update-menus &gt; /dev/null; then update-menus ; fi
