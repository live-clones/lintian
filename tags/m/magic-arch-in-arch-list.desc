Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Check: fields/architecture
Info: The special architecture value "any" only makes sense if it occurs
 alone or (in a *.dsc file) together with "all". The value "all" may
 appear together with other architectures in a *.dsc file but must
 occur alone if used in a binary package.
