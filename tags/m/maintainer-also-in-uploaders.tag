Severity: warning
Check: fields/uploaders
Explanation: The maintainer value also appears on the <code>Uploaders</code> field.
 There were some reasons why this was useful when Uploaders support was
 first introduced, but those have long-since been fixed and there is no
 longer any need to list the maintainer in Uploaders. The duplicate
 information should probably be removed.
