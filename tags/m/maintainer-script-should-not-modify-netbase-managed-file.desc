Tag: maintainer-script-should-not-modify-netbase-managed-file
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Check: scripts
Info: The maintainer script modifies at least one of the files
 <tt>/etc/services</tt>, <tt>/etc/protocols</tt>, and <tt>/etc/rpc</tt>,
 which are managed by the netbase package. Instead of doing this, please
 file a wishlist bug against netbase to have an appropriate entry added.
