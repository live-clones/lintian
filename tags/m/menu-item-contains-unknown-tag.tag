Tag: menu-item-contains-unknown-tag
Severity: warning
Check: menu-format
Explanation: The menu item has a line that has a tag in it that is not one
 of the standard tags (needs=, section=, title=, longtitle=, command=, etc).
 While other tags can be used for specialized purposes, this is rare and
 it's more likely the tag's name is misspelled.
