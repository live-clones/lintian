Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: <tt>chown user.group</tt> is called in one of the maintainer
 scripts. The correct syntax is <tt>chown user:group</tt>. Using "." as a
 separator is still supported by the GNU tools, but it will fail as soon
 as a system uses the "." in user or group names.
