Tag: maintainer-script-calls-install-sgmlcatalog
Severity: error
Check: scripts
Renamed-From: maintainer-script-should-not-use-install-sgmlcatalog
Explanation: The maintainer script apparently runs install-sgmlcatalog.
 install-sgmlcatalog is deprecated and should only have been used
 in postinst or prerm to remove the entries from earlier packages.
 Given how long ago this transition was, consider removing it
 entirely.
