Info: The package is architecture-dependent, ships a static library in a
 public, architecture-dependent library search path and is marked
 <tt>Multi-Arch: foreign</tt>. A compiler will be unable to find this file,
 unless it is installed for a matching architecture, but the <tt>foreign</tt>
 marking says that the architecture should not matter.
