Severity: pedantic
Check: scripts
See-Also: policy 10.4
Explanation: The maintainer script passes <tt>-e</tt> to the shell on the
 <tt>#!</tt> line rather than using <tt>set -e</tt> in the body of the
 script. This is fine for normal operation, but if the script is run by
 hand with <tt>sh /path/to/script</tt> (common in debugging), <tt>-e</tt>
 will not be in effect. It's therefore better to use <tt>set -e</tt> in
 the body of the script.
