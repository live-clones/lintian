Explanation: The installation location <code>/usr/lib/menu</code> for
 <code>menu</code> files has been deprecated since version 2.1.25 (but
 still works). Menu files should go into <code>/usr/share/menu</code>.
 .
 Only menu files that are compiled executables still need to go into
 <code>/usr/lib/menu</code>.
