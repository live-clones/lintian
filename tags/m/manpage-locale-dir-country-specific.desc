Ref: policy 12.1
Info: This package installs a manual page in a locale directory that
 includes the country name. A country name should not be included in the
 directory name unless it indicates a significant difference in the
 language. The known cases where country names are appropriate are pt_BR
 and zh_*. Please file a bug against Lintian if this is another case
 where a country name is appropriate.
