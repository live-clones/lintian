Severity: serious
Certainty: possible
Check: files/architecture
Ref: policy 9.1.1
Info: This package contains a directory under <tt>/lib</tt> or
 <tt>/usr/lib</tt> which doesn't match the proper triplet for the
 binary package's architecture. This is very likely to be a mistake
 when indicating the underlying build system where the files should be
 installed.
