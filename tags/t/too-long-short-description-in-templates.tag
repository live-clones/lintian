Tag: too-long-short-description-in-templates
Severity: warning
Check: debian/debconf
Explanation: The short description should be kept short (50 characters or so) so
 that it may be accommodated by most debconf interfaces. Keeping it short
 also helps translators, as usually translations tend to end up being
 longer than the original.
