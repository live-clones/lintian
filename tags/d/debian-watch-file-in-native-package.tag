Severity: warning
Check: debian/watch
See-Also: https://wiki.debian.org/DEHS
Explanation: The package ships a watch file although it is a Debian native
 package. DEHS does not process watch files in native packages based on
 the reasoning that native packages do not have upstreams to check for new
 releases.
