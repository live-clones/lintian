Severity: error
Check: fields/version
Renamed-From: debian-revision-should-not-be-zero
Explanation: The Debian version part (the part after the -) should start with one,
 not with zero. This is to ensure that a correctly-done Maintainer Upload will
 always have a higher version number than a Non-Maintainer upload: a NMU could
 have been prepared which introduces this upstream version with
 Debian-revision -0.1
