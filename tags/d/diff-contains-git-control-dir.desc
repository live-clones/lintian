Info: The Debian diff or native package contains files in a .git
 directory. These are usually artifacts of the revision control system
 used by the Debian maintainer and not useful in a diff or native package.
 <tt>dpkg-source</tt> will automatically exclude these if it is passed
 <tt>-I</tt> or <tt>-i</tt> for native and non-native packages respectively.
