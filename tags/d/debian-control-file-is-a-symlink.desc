Tag: debian-control-file-is-a-symlink
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Check: control-file
Info: The <tt>debian/control</tt> file is a symlink rather than a regular
 file. Using symlinks for required source package files is unnecessary and
 makes package checking and manipulation more difficult. If the control
 file should be available in the source package under multiple names, make
 <tt>debian/control</tt> the real file and the other names symlinks to it.
