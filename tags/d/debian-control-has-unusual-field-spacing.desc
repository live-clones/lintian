Severity: pedantic
Check: debian/control
See-Also: policy 5.1
Explanation: The field on this line of <tt>debian/control</tt> has whitespace
 other than a single space after the colon. This is explicitly permitted
 in the syntax of Debian control files, but as Policy says, it is
 conventional to put a single space after the colon.
