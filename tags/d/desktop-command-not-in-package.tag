Severity: warning
Check: menu-format
Explanation: The desktop entry specifies a command that is not available in the
 package. In most cases, this is a typo or a forgotten update of the
 desktop file after the install location of the binary was changed. A
 desktop file for a command should be included in the same package as that
 command.
