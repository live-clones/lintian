Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Check: debian/watch
Ref: uscan(1), https://wiki.debian.org/DEHS
Info: The version of this package contains <tt>dfsg</tt>, <tt>ds</tt>,
 or <tt>debian</tt>, which normally indicates that the upstream source
 has been repackaged to comply with the Debian Free Software Guidelines
 (or similar reason), but there is no version mangling in the
 <tt>debian/watch</tt> file. Since the <tt>dfsg</tt> string is not
 part of the upstream version, the <tt>debian/watch</tt> file should
 use the dversionmangle option to remove the <tt>dfsg</tt> before
 version number comparison.
