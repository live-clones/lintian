Tag: debian-news-entry-uses-asterisk
Severity: info
Check: debian/changelog
Info: The latest entry in NEWS.Debian appears to use asterisks to present
 changes in a bulleted list, similar to the normal changelog syntax. The
 Debian Developer's Reference recommends using regular paragraphs in
 NEWS.Debian rather than a bulleted list.
