Tag: debug-file-with-no-debug-symbols
Severity: warning
Check: binaries
Ref: #668437
Info: The binary is installed as a detached "debug symbols" ELF file,
 but it does not appear to have debug information associated with it.
 .
 A common cause is not passing <tt>-g</tt> to GCC when compiling.
 .
 Implementation detail: Lintian checks for the ".debug_line" and the
 ".debug_str" sections. If either of these are present, the binary
 is assumed to contain debug information.
