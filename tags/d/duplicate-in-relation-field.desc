Severity: pedantic
Check: debian/control
Explanation: The given field in the <tt>debian/control</tt> file contains
 relations that are either identical or imply each other. The less
 restrictive one can be removed. This is done automatically by
 <tt>dpkg-source</tt> and <tt>dpkg-gencontrol</tt>, so this does not
 affect the generated package.
