Severity: warning
Check: testsuite
See-Also: autodep8(1)
Explanation: The specified autopkgtest control file is considered obsolete.
 .
 Before autodep8 version 0.17 and autopkgtest version 5.7 if a
 maintainer wished to add tests to the set of tests generated
 by autodep8 they provided those tests in a file named
 <tt>debian/tests/control.autodep8</tt>.
 .
 It is now prefered to declare the additional tests in the regular
 <tt>debian/tests/control</tt> file so that <tt>dpkg-source</tt> can
 pick up the test dependencies.
 .
 When configured to run autodep8 tests, autopkgtest will run the
 additional tests and the autodep8 tests when <tt>debian/control</tt>
 has the proper <tt>Testsuite: autopkgtest-*</tt> in the source
 headers.
 .
 Please merge the specified file into <tt>debian/tests/control</tt>.
