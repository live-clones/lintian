Tag: debhelper-tools-from-autotools-dev-are-deprecated
Severity: warning
Check: debhelper
Explanation: The debhelper tools from autotools-dev has been replaced by the tool
 <tt>dh_update_autotools_config</tt>, which was available in
 debhelper (&gt;= 9.20160114)
 .
 The <tt>dh_update_autotools_config</tt> is run by default via the <tt>dh</tt>
 command sequencer. If you are using <tt>dh</tt>, you can probably just remove
 the uses of the tooling from autotools-dev without doing any further changes.
 .
 If you use the "classic" debhelper style, then please replace all
 calls to <tt>dh_autotools-dev_updateconfig</tt> with
 <tt>dh_update_autotools_config</tt>. The calls to
 <tt>dh_autotools-dev_restoreconfig</tt> are replaced by
 <tt>dh_clean</tt>, so they can most likely just be removed without
 any further changes.
