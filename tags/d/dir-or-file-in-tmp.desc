Severity: error
Check: files/hierarchy-standard
Info: Packages must not install files into <tt>/tmp</tt> or
 <tt>/var/tmp</tt>. The File Hierarchy Standard specifies that such files
 may be removed by the administrator and that programs may not depend on
 any files in <tt>/tmp</tt> being preserved across invocations, which
 combined mean that it makes no sense to ship files in these directories.
