Info: This file is in a location generally used for detached debugging
 symbols, but it appears to contain a complete copy of the executable or
 library instead of only the debugging symbols. Files in subdirectories
 of <tt>/usr/lib/debug</tt> mirroring the main file system should contain
 only debugging information generated by <tt>objcopy
 --only-keep-debug</tt>. Binaries or shared objects built with extra
 debugging should be installed directly in <tt>/usr/lib/debug</tt> or in
 subdirectories corresponding to the package, not in the directories that
 mirror the main file system.
 .
 If you are using dh_strip with the --dbg-package flag, don't also install
 the library in <tt>/usr/lib/debug</tt>. dh_strip does all the work for
 you.
