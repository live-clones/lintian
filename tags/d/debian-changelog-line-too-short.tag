 This can make it hard for others to understand the changelog entry.
 Please keep in mind that:

  - It is not uncommon that people read changelog entries that are more
    than a decade old to understand why a change was made or why a
    package works in a specific way.
  - Many users will read the changelog via
    <code>apt-listchanges(1)</code>
  - The information in <code>debian/changelog</code> is permanent.

 Examples for entries that are too short include "dh 11" or simply

  - Switch to debhelper compat 11.
  - Set Rules-Requires-Root: no.
