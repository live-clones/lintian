Tag: declares-possibly-conflicting-debhelper-compat-versions
Severity: error
Check: debhelper
See-Also: debhelper(7)
Explanation: The source package declares the debhelper compatibility version
 both in the <tt>debian/compat</tt> file and in the <tt>debian/rules</tt>
 file. If these ever get out of synchronisation, the package may not build
 as expected.
