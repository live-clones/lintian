Explanation: The version of this package contains <tt>dfsg</tt>, <tt>ds</tt>,
 or <tt>debian</tt>, but a misleading upstream version mangling occurs in
 the <tt>debian/watch</tt> file. Since the <tt>dfsg</tt> string is not
 part of the upstream version and its addition is Debian-specific, the
 <tt>debian/watch</tt> file should use the dversionmangle option to
 remove, instead of adding in uversionmangle, the <tt>dfsg</tt> before
 comparing version numbers.
