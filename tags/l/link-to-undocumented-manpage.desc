 The lack of a manual page is still a bug, and if at all possible you
 should write one yourself.
 .
 For help with writing manual pages, refer to the Man-Page-HOWTO at
 http://www.schweikhardt.net/man_page_howto.html, the examples created
 by <tt>dh_make</tt>, or the
 <tt>/usr/share/doc/man-db/examples</tt> directory.
 If the package provides <tt>--help</tt> output, you might want to use
 the <tt>help2man</tt> utility to generate a simple manual page.
