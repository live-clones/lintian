Tag: runtime-test-file-uses-supported-python-versions-without-python-all-build-depends
Severity: warning
Check: testsuite
Info: The specified file appears to use <tt>py3versions -s</tt> to
 determine the "supported" Python versions without specifying
 <tt>python3-all</tt> as a build-dependency.
 .
 With only the default version of Python installed, the autopkgtests may
 pass but the package subsequently faisl at runtime when another,
 non-default, Python version is present.
 .
 Please add <tt>python3-all</tt> as a build-dependency.
