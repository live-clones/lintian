Tag: readme-debian-mentions-usr-doc
Severity: warning
Check: debian/readme
Explanation: The README.Debian file installed by this package apparently points
 users at /usr/doc. /usr/doc has been retired and all documentation
 migrated to /usr/share/doc. This reference should probably also be
 updated.
