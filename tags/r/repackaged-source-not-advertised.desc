Severity: info
Check: debian/copyright/dep5
Info: The <tt>debian/copyright</tt> file mentions <tt>Files-Excluded</tt>
 but the source version has no repack suffix.
 .
 Repackaged sources are expected to indicate in their version number
 that they are different from the upstream release. It is commonly
 done by adding a repack suffix to the upstream version.
 .
 The choice of repack suffix depends on the reason for repackaging.
 When some files were excluded because licensing was a concern, the
 suffix <tt>+dfsg</tt> may be appropriate. In more generic cases, one
 could chose <tt>+ds</tt>.
 .
 Upstream sources are sometimes repackaged by accident when using old
 versions of <tt>dh_make</tt>. It can also happen when a maintainer
 invokes the dh_make option <tt>--createorig</tt> even though it is
 not needed.
 .
 According to the Debian Developer's Reference 6.7.8.2, the repack
 suffix is not required.
 .
 Please include such a suffix in the changelog version number to avoid
 this warning.
