Tag: pkg-not-in-package-test
Severity: warning
Check: menu-format
Explanation: This menu item doesn't test to see if the package containing it is
 installed. The start of any menu item is a conditional testing whether
 the required packages are installed. Normally this conditional should
 always check at least the package containing it, since menu items should
 be included in the package that provides the application the menu refers
 to.
 .
 This error usually indicates a misspelling of the package name in the
 menu entry or a copied menu entry from another package that doesn't apply
 to this one.
