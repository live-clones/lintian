Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This package installs a file <tt>perllocal.pod</tt>. Since that
 file is intended for local documentation, it is not likely that it is
 a good place for documentation supplied by a Debian package. In fact,
 installing this package will wipe out whatever local documentation
 existed there.
