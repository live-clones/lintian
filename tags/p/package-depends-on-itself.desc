Severity: warning
Check: debian/control
See-Also: policy 7.2
Explanation: The given package declares a dependency on itself in its
 <tt>debian/control</tt> stanza. Current versions of dpkg-gencontrol will
 silently fix this problem by removing the dependency, but it may indicate
 a more subtle bug (misspelling or cutting and pasting the wrong package
 name).
