Tag: package-contains-vcs-control-file
Severity: warning
Check: files/vcs
Explanation: The package contains a VCS control file such as .(cvs|git|hg)ignore.
 Files such as these are used by revision control systems to, for example,
 specify untracked files it should ignore or inventory files. This file
 is generally useless in an installed package and was probably installed
 by accident.
