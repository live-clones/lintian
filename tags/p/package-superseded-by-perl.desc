Tag: package-superseded-by-perl
Severity: warning
Check: fields/version
Explanation: This package is also provided by one of the Perl core packages
 (perl, perl-base, perl-modules), and the core version is at least
 as new as this one.
 .
 The package should either be upgraded to a newer upstream version
 or removed from the archive as unnecessary. In the removal case, any
 versioned dependencies on this package must first be changed to include
 the Perl core package (because versioned dependencies are not satisfied
 by provided packages).
 .
 The recommended way to express the dependency without needless
 complications on backporting packages is to use alternative dependencies.
 The perl package should be the preferred alternative and the
 versioned dependency a secondary one.
 .
 Example: perl (&gt;= 5.10.0) | libmodule-build-perl (&gt;= 0.26)
 .
 Running <tt>cme fix dpkg -from control -filter Depends</tt> should be able
 to update these dependencies.
