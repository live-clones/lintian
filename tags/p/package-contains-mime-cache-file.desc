Tag: package-contains-mime-cache-file
Severity: error
Check: mimeinfo
Explanation: This package contains a cache file generated automatically by
 update-mime-database when a package containing MIME-Info Database
 files is installed. Some upstream build systems create them
 automatically, but they must not be included in a package since they need
 to be generated dynamically based on the installed MIME-Info Database
 files on the system.
