Tag: postinst-uses-db-input
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Check: debian/debconf
Info: It is generally not a good idea for postinst scripts to use debconf
 commands like <tt>db_input</tt>. Typically, they should restrict themselves
 to <tt>db_get</tt> to request previously acquired information, and have the
 config script do the actual prompting.
