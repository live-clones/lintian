Explanation: This package creates a potential privacy breach by fetching W3C
 validation icons.

 These badges may be displayed to tell readers that care has been
 taken to make a page compliant with W3C standards. Unfortunately,
 downloading the image from www.w3.org might expose the reader's IP
 address to potential tracking.

 Note that these icons are non-free and must not be copied into the
 package. You could safely delete this W3C validation badge.
