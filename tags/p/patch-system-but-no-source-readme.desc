Tag: patch-system-but-no-source-readme
Severity: warning
Check: debian/patches
Info: This package build-depends on a patch system such as dpatch or
 quilt, but there is no <tt>debian/README.source</tt> file. This file is
 recommended for any package where <tt>dpkg-source -x</tt> does not result
 in the preferred form for making modifications to the package.
 .
 If you are using quilt and the package needs no other special handling
 instructions, you may want to add a <tt>debian/README.source</tt>
 referring to <tt>/usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source</tt>. Similarly, you
 can refer to <tt>/usr/share/doc/dpatch/README.source.gz</tt> for dpatch.
