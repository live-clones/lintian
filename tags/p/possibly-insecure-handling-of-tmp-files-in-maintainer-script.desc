Tag: possibly-insecure-handling-of-tmp-files-in-maintainer-script
Severity: warning
Check: scripts
Info: The maintainer script seems to access a file in <tt>/tmp</tt> or
 some other temporary directory. Since creating temporary files in a
 world-writable directory is very dangerous, this is likely to be a
 security bug. Use the <tt>tempfile</tt> or <tt>mktemp</tt> utilities to
 create temporary files in these directories.
