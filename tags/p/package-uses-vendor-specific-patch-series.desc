Tag: package-uses-vendor-specific-patch-series
Severity: error
Check: debian/patches/quilt
Explanation: The specified series file for patches is vendor-specific.
 .
 Source packages may contain vendor (i.e. distribution) specific patches,
 but such packages must not be uploaded to the Debian archive if they
 are used in conjunction with vendor-specific series files.
 .
 Vendor specific series files were carefully implemented as a <tt>dpkg</tt>
 feature. Unfortunately, they currently conflict with some workflow goals
 in Debian. They are presently disallowed in Debian.
 .
 The preferred approach for distributions other than Debian is now to
 apply such patches programmatically via <tt>debian/rules</tt>. You can
 also create multiple, vendor-specific sources and upload them separately
 for each distribution.
 .
 The decision to prohibit the use of that particular <tt>dpkg</tt> feature
 in Debian was made by the project's technical committee in consideration of
 other planned workflow modifications, and may be revisited.
 .
 You should only see this tag in Debian or other distributions when 
 targeting an upload for Debian.
