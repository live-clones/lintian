Severity: warning
Check: documentation
Ref: policy 12.3
Info: Binary packages do not need to contain the instructions for building
 and installing the package as this info is not needed by package users.
 If the info contained is important for configuration perhaps it could be
 summarized in README.Debian, otherwise an override may be added.
