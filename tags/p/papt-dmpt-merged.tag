Explanation: The Python Applications Packaging Team (PAPT) has been merged with
  the Debian Python Module Team (DPMT) to create the new Debian Python Team
  (DPT). As such, the Maintainer for this package should now be
  <code>Debian Python Team <team+python@tracker.debian.org></code>.
 .
 This is not currently the case and the package's Maintainer field should be
 updated.
