Check: init.d
Renamed-From: init.d-script-should-depend-on-virtual-facility
Info: The given <tt>/etc/init.d</tt> script depends on a non-virtual
 facility that should probably be replaced by a virtual facility. For
 example, init scripts should depend on the virtual facility
 <tt>$network</tt> rather than the facility <tt>networking</tt>, and the
 virtual facility <tt>$named</tt> rather than the specific facility
 <tt>bind9</tt>.
 .
 Properly using virtual facilities allows multiple implementations of the
 same facility and accommodates systems where that specific facility may
 not be enough to provide everything the script expects.
