Renamed-From: binary-without-english-manpage
Info: Each binary in <tt>/usr/bin</tt>, <tt>/usr/sbin</tt>, <tt>/bin</tt>,
 <tt>/sbin</tt> or <tt>/usr/games</tt> should have a manual page. You do
 not provide an English manual page, but only a translated one.
 .
 Since the English language serves as a fallback option, the lack of an
 English page leaves most users without any kind of manual page at all.
