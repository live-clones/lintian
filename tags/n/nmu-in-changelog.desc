Info: The first line of the changelog entry for this package appears to
 indicate it is a non-maintainer upload (by including either that string
 or the string "NMU" and not saying that it's an acknowledgement), but the
 changelog indicates the person making this release is one of the
 maintainers.

 If this was intended to be an NMU, do not add yourself as a maintainer or
 uploader. Otherwise, please rephrase your changelog entry to not cause
 confusion.
