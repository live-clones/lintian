Explanation: The Python Applications Packaging Team (PAPT) has been merged with
  the Debian Python Module Team (DPMT) to create the new Debian Python Team
  (DPT). As such, its VCS should now be in Salsa under
  <code>https://salsa.debian.org/python-team/packages</code>.
 .
 This is not currently the case and the package's VCS should be migrated to the
 proper location.
