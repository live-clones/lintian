Explanation: The Debian Python Module Team (DPMT) has been merged with the
  Python Applications Packaging Team (PAPT) to create the new Debian Python Team
  (DPT). As such, its VCS should now be in Salsa under
  <code>https://salsa.debian.org/python-team/packages</code>.
 .
 This is not currently the case and the package's VCS should be migrated to the
 proper location.
