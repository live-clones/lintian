Severity: wishlist
Certainty: possible
Info: This package installs a compiled interface (<tt>.cmi</tt>) without
 its text version (<tt>.mli</tt>). The text version should also be
 installed for documentation purpose. If the module involved doesn't have
 a <tt>.mli</tt>, its source code (<tt>.ml</tt>) should be installed
 instead.
