 recommended for use in publications, etc., will always redirect to current
 release version (or devel if package is not in release yet). For example, the
 link for the package "foo" should be:
 .
 https://bioconductor.org/packages/foo/
 .
 not:
 .
 https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/(release|devel|&ast;)/bioc/html/foo.html
