Info: The given control file uses <tt>CRLF</tt> as line terminator
 instead of the traditional UNIX <tt>LF</tt> terminator. Since some
 tools were only designed with the UNIX end-of-line terminators in mind,
 it is possible that they misbehave or lead to unexpected results.
 .
 Running the following command against the given file removes any
 <tt>CR</tt> character in the file:
 .
 <tt>sed -i 's/\r//g' path/to/file</tt>
