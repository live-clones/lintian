Tag: compressed-symlink-with-wrong-ext
Severity: error
Check: files/symbolic-links
Explanation: The package installs a symbolic link pointing to a compressed file,
 but the symbolic link does not use the same file extension than the
 referenced file. In most cases, this can produce troubles when the
 user or a program tries to access the file through the link.
