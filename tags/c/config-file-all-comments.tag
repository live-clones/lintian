Tag: config-file-all-comments
Severity: classification
Check: conffiles
Explanation: This classification-only tag tracks configuration files in /etc
 that contain only comments and blank lines. This is helpful for developers
 seeking to build minimal systems without placeholder files, or developers
 looking to notice such placeholders and move them to documentation examples.
