Tag: web-application-should-not-depend-unconditionally-on-apache2
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The package appears to be a web application but declares a dependency
 against <tt>apache2</tt> without any alternative. Most web applications should
 work with any decent web server, thus such a package should be satisfied if any
 web server providing the virtual "<tt>httpd</tt>" package is installed. This
 can be accomplished by declaring a package relation in the form "<tt>apache2 |
 httpd</tt>".
