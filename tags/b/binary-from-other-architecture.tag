Tag: binary-from-other-architecture
Severity: error
Check: binaries/architecture/other
Explanation: This ELF binary appears to have been built for an architecture other
 than the one of the binary package being tested. This may occur when a
 pre-built binary is shipped in the package or when an attempt to
 cross-compile didn't work.
