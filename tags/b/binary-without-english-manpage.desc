Tag: binary-without-english-manpage
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: Each binary in <tt>/usr/bin</tt>, <tt>/usr/sbin</tt>, <tt>/bin</tt>,
 <tt>/sbin</tt> or <tt>/usr/games</tt> should have a manual page. You don't
 provide an English, only a translated manpage. Since English is fallback,
 shipping only a non-English man page leaves most users without a man page
 at all.
