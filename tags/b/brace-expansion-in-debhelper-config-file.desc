Tag: brace-expansion-in-debhelper-config-file
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Check: debhelper
Info: This debhelper config file appears to use shell brace expansion
 (such as <tt>{foo,bar}</tt>) to specify files. This happens to work due
 to an accident of implementation but is not a supported feature. Only
 <tt>?</tt>, <tt>*</tt>, and <tt>[...]</tt> are supported.
