Tag: binary-has-unneeded-section
Severity: info
Check: binaries
Explanation: The binary or shared library is stripped, but still contains a
 section that is not useful. You should call strip with
 <tt>--remove-section=.comment --remove-section=.note</tt> to remove the
 <tt>.note</tt> and <tt>.comment</tt> sections.
 .
 <tt>dh_strip</tt> will do this automatically for you, but
 <tt>install -s</tt> will not because it calls strip without any
 arguments.
