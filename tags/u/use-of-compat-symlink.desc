Tag: use-of-compat-symlink
Severity: error
Check: files/hierarchy/standard
Explanation: This package uses a directory that, according to the Filesystem
 Hierarchy Standard, should exist only as a compatibility symlink.
 Packages should not traverse such symlinks when installing files, they
 should use the standard directories instead.
