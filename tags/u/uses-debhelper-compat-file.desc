Tag: uses-debhelper-compat-file
Severity: pedantic
Check: debhelper
Explanation: This package uses a <tt>debian/compat</tt> file to denote the
 required debhelper compatibility number.
 .
 However, debhelper has replaced <tt>debian/compat</tt> with the
 <tt>debhelper-compat</tt> virtual package for most circumstances.
 .
 Packages not using an experimental or beta compatibility level should
 Build-Depend on the <tt>debhelper-compat</tt> virtual package, for
 example:
 .
  Build-Depends: debhelper-compat (= 13)
