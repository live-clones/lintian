Tag: unknown-control-interpreter
Severity: error
Check: scripts
Explanation: This package contains a maintainer script that uses an interpreter
 that the Lintian maintainers have not heard of. This is usually a typo
 for a common interpreter. If not, please file a wishlist bug on Lintian
 so that the Lintian maintainers can add this interpreter to their list.
