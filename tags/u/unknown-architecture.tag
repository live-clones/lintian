Tag: unknown-architecture
Severity: warning
Check: fields/architecture
Explanation: This package claims to be for an unknown architecture. The
 architecture should be one of the values supported by dpkg or one of the
 special values "all" or "any". The special value "source" is only used
 in &ast;.changes files and does not make sense in a binary package or a &ast;.dsc
 file.
