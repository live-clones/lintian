      <title>About Lintian</title>
      <para>
        Lintian is a Debian package checker. It can be used to check
        binary and source packages for compliance with the Debian
        policy and for other common packaging errors.
      </para>
      <para>
        Lintian uses an archive directory, called laboratory, in which
        it stores information about the packages it examines.  It can
        keep this information between multiple invocations in order to
        avoid repeating expensive data-collection operations. It's
        also possible to check the complete Debian archive for bugs
        &mdash; in a timely manner.
      </para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 label="1.2" id="section-1.2">
      <title>The intention of Lintian</title>
      <para>
        Packaging has become complicated&mdash;not because dpkg is
        complicated (indeed, dpkg-deb is very simple to use) but
        because of the high requirements of our policy. If a developer
        releases a new package, she has to consider hundreds of
        guidelines to make the package `policy compliant.'
      </para>
      <para>
        All parts of our policy have been introduced by the same procedure:
        Some developer has a good idea how to make packages more `unique' with
        respect to a certain aspect&mdash;then the idea is discussed and a policy
        proposal is prepared. If we have a consensus about the policy change,
        it's introduced in our manuals.
      </para>
      <para>
        Therefore, our policy is <emphasis>not</emphasis> designed to
        make life harder for the maintainers! The intention is to make
        Debian the best Linux distribution out there. With this in
        mind, lots of policy changes are discussed on the mailing
        lists each week.
      </para>
      <para>
        But changing the policy is only a small part of the story:
        Just having some statement included in the manual does not
        make Debian any better. What's needed is for that policy to
        become `real life,' i.e.,
        it's <emphasis>implemented</emphasis> in our packages. And
        this is where Lintian comes in: Lintian checks packages and
        reports possible policy violations. (Of course, not everything
        can be checked mechanically &mdash; but a lot of things can
        and this is what Lintian is for.)
      </para>
      <para>Thus, Lintian has the following goals:</para>
      <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <emphasis>To give us some impression of the `gap'
              between theory (written policy) and praxis (current state of
              implementation).</emphasis>
          </para>
          <para>
            From the results of the first two Lintian checks I
            implemented, I see that there is a big need to make this
            gap smaller. Introducing more policy aspects is worthless
            unless they are implemented. We first should fix packages
            to comply with current policy before searching for new
            ways to make policy more detailed. (Of course, there are
            also important policy changes that need to be introduced
            &mdash; but this is not what's meant here.)
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <emphasis>
              To make us re-think about certain aspects of our policy.
            </emphasis>
          </para>
          <para>
            For example, it could turn out that some ideas that once
            sounded great in theory are hard to implement in all our
            packages &mdash; in which case we should rework this
            aspect of policy.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <emphasis>
              To show us where to concentrate our efforts in order to
              make Debian a higher quality distribution.
            </emphasis>
          </para>
          <para>
            Most release requirements will be implemented through
            policy.  Lintian reports provide an easy way to
            compare <emphasis>all</emphasis> our packages against
            policy and keep track of the fixing process by watching
            bug reports.  Note, that all this can be
            done <emphasis>automatically</emphasis>.
          </para>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>To make us avoid making the same mistakes all over again.</emphasis>
          </para>
          <para>
            Being humans, it's natural for us to make errors. Since we
            all have the ability to learn from our mistakes, this is
            actually no big problem.  Once an important bug is
            discovered, a Lintian check could be written to check for
            exactly this bug. This will prevent the bug from appearing
            in any future revisions of any of our packages.

          <para>
            Lintian is not finished yet and will probably never
            be. Please don't use Lintian as a reference for Debian
            policy. Lintian might miss a lot of policy violations
            while it might also report some violations by mistake. If
            in doubt, please check out the policy manuals.

            The Debian policy gives the maintainers a lot of
            freedom. In most cases, the guidelines included in the
            manuals allow exceptions. Thus, if Lintian reports a
            policy violation on a package and you think this is such
            an exception (or if you think Lintian has a bug) you can
            do two things: If your package is a bit non-standard and
            weird in this regard, you can install an override. If you
            think however that the check is too easily or outright
            wrongly triggered, please file a bug on the lintian
            package.

          <para>
            Please DO NOT use Lintian to file bug reports (neither
            single ones nor mass bug reports). This is done by the
            authors of Lintian already and duplication of efforts and
            bug reports should be avoided! If you think a certain bug
            is `critical' and should be reported/fixed immediately,
            please contact the maintainer of the corresponding package
            and/or the Lintian maintainers.

      <title>Installing Lintian</title>
      <para>
        Before you can start to check your packages with Lintian,
        you'll have to install
        the <systemitem role="package">lintian</systemitem> Debian
        package.
      </para>
      <para>
        Alternatively you can checkout Lintian from the source
        repository and use that directly.  By setting LINTIAN_ROOT (or
        using the --root option) lintian can be run from the source
        directory as if it had been installed on your system.
      </para>
      <para>
        The only known caveat of using Lintian from the source
        directory is that Lintian requires a C.UTF-8 (or en_US.UTF-8)
        locale to correctly process some files.
        The <systemitem role="package">lintian</systemitem> Debian
        package will set up this locale during installation.

        After that, you can run Lintian on a changes file or any
        Debian binary, udeb or source packages like this:

        Please note that some checks are cross-package checks and can
        only be (accurately) performed if the binary packages and the

        Lintian supports a number of command line options, which are
        documented in the manpage of lintian(1).  Some of the options

        Lintian uses a special format for all its error and warning

        which run Lintian and interpret the displayed messages.
      </para>
      <para>
        The first character of each line indicates the type of

            <para>
              The displayed message indicates a policy violation or a
              packaging error. For policy violations, Lintian will
              cite the appropriate policy section when it is invoked

              The displayed message might be a policy violation or packaging
              error. A warning is usually an indication that the test is
              known to sometimes produce false positive alarms, because either
              the corresponding rule in policy has many exceptions or the test
              uses some sort of heuristic to find errors.

              Lintian, and might still give surprising results.  Feel

      <title>Overrides</title>
      <para>
        In some cases, the checked package does not have a bug or does
        not violate policy, but Lintian still reports an error or
        warning. This can have the following reasons: Lintian has a
        bug itself, a specific Lintian check is not smart enough to
        know about a special case allowed by policy, or the policy
        does allow exceptions to some rule in general.
      </para>
      <para>
        In the first case (where Lintian has a bug) you should send a
        bug report to the Debian bug tracking system and describe
        which package you checked, which messages have been displayed,
        and why you think Lintian has a bug. Best would be, if you
        would run Lintian again over your packages using
        the <option>-d</option> (or <option>--debug</option>) option,
        which will cause Lintian to output much more information
        (debugging info), and include these messages in your bug
        report. This will simplify the debugging process for the
        authors of Lintian.
      </para>
      <para>
        In the other two cases (where the error is actually an exception to
        policy), you should probably add an override. If you're unsure though whether
        it's indeed a good case for an override, you should contact the Lintian
        maintainers too, including the Lintian error message and a short note, stating
        why you think this is an exception. This way, the Lintian maintainers can be
        sure the problem is not actually a bug in Lintian or an error in the author's
        reading of policy. Please do not override bugs in lintian, they should rather
        be fixed than overridden.
      </para>
      <para>
        Once it has been decided that an override is needed, you can easily add one by
        supplying an overrides file. If the override is for a binary or udeb
        package, you have to place it at
        <filename>/usr/share/lintian/overrides/<replaceable>&lt;package&gt;</replaceable></filename>
        inside the package.  The tool <command>dh_lintian</command>
        from the Debian
        package <systemitem role="package">debhelper</systemitem> may
        be useful for this purpose.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the override is for a source package, you have to place it
        at <filename>debian/source/lintian-overrides</filename>
        or <filename>debian/source.lintian-overrides</filename> (the
        former path is preferred). With that, Lintian will know about
        this exception and not report the problem again when checking
        your package. (Actually, Lintian will report the problem
        again, but with type <emphasis>overridden</emphasis>, see
        above.)
      </para>
      <para>
        Note that Lintian extracts the override file from the (u)deb
        and stores it in the laboratory. The files currently installed
        on the system are not used in current Lintian versions.
      </para>
      <para>
        The format of the overrides file is simple, it consists of one override per
        line (and may contain empty lines and comments, starting with a <literal>#</literal>, on others):
        <literal>[[<replaceable>&lt;package&gt;</replaceable>][ <replaceable>&lt;archlist&gt;</replaceable>][ <replaceable>&lt;type&gt;</replaceable>]: ]<replaceable>&lt;lintian-tag&gt;</replaceable>[
          [*]<replaceable>&lt;lintian-info&gt;</replaceable>[*]]</literal>.  <replaceable>&lt;package&gt;</replaceable> is the package name;
        <replaceable>&lt;archlist&gt;</replaceable> is an architecture list
        in the same format as for the Build-Depends field (except architecture wildcards are not supported);
        <replaceable>&lt;type&gt;</replaceable> is one of <literal>binary</literal>, <literal>udeb</literal> and
        <literal>source</literal>,
        and <replaceable>&lt;lintian-info&gt;</replaceable> is all
        additional information provided by Lintian except for the
        tag. What's inside brackets is optional and may be omitted if
        you want to match it all.  An example file for a binary
        package would look like:
      </para>
      <screen>
/usr/share/lintian/overrides/foo, where foo is the name of your package

# We use a non-standard dir permission to only allow the webserver to look
# into this directory:
foo binary: non-standard-dir-perm
foo binary: FSSTND-dir-in-usr /usr/man/man1/foo.1.gz
</screen>
      <para>An example file for a source package would look like:</para>
      <screen>
debian/source.lintian-overrides in your base source directory
foo source: debian-files-list-in-source
# Upstream distributes it like this, repacking would be overkill though, so
# tell lintian to not complain:
foo source: configure-generated-file-in-source config.cache
</screen>
      <para>
        Many tags can occur more than once (e.g. if the same error is
        found in more than one file). You can override a tag either
        completely by specifying its name (first line in the examples)
        or only one occurrence of it by specifying the additional
        info, too (second line in the examples).  If you add an
        asterisk (<literal>*</literal>) in the additional info, this
        will match arbitrary strings similar to the shell wildcard.
      </para>
      <para>
        The first wildcard support appeared in Lintian 2.0.0, which
        only allowed the wildcards in the very beginning or end.
        Version 2.5.0~rc4 extended this to allow wildcards any where
        in the additional info.

      <title>Vendor Profiles</title>
      <para>
        Vendor profiles allows vendors and users to customize Lintian
        without having to modify the underlying code.  If a profile
        is not explicitly given, Lintian will derive the best
        possible profile for the current vendor from dpkg-vendor.

      <sect2 label="2.5.1" id="section-2.5.1">
        <title>Rules for profile names and location</title>
        <para>
          Profile names should only consist of the lower case
          characters ([a-z]), underscore (_), dash (-) and
          forward slashes (/).  Particularly note that dot (.) are
          specificially <emphasis>not</emphasis> allowed in a
          profile name.
        </para>
        <para>
          The default profile for a vendor is called
          <filename>$VENDOR/main</filename>.  If Lintian sees a
          profile name without a slash, it is taken as a short
          form of the default profile for a vendor with that
          name.
        </para>
        <para>
          The filename for the profile is derived from the name by
          simply concatenating it with <filename>.profile</filename>,
          Lintian will then look for a file with that name in the
          follownig directories:

          <option>-S</option></command> to set up the laboratory and
        to create lists of all binary and source packages in the
        distribution. (Note, that this might take some time&hellip;)
      </para>
      <para>After that, you can either check single packages simply be running
      <screen>
  $ lintian foo
</screen>
      (without path or extension for the
      package <systemitem role="package">foo</systemitem>) or check
      the whole distribution with
      <screen>
  $ lintian --all
</screen>
</para>
      <para>
        Since Lintian needs an up-to-date list of packages in the
	distribution, you'll have to rerun
	the <command>lintian <option>-S</option></command> command
	whenever the distribution directory has been changed. (But
	there is no need to remove the laboratory in this situation:
	Lintian is smart enough to only re-unpack packages that have
	been changed.)
