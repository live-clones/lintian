Description: Debian package checker
 Lintian dissects Debian packages and reports bugs and policy
 violations. It contains automated checks for many aspects of Debian
 policy as well as some checks for common errors.
 .
 It uses an archive directory, called laboratory, in which it stores
 information about the packages it examines.  It can keep this
 information between multiple invocations in order to avoid repeating
 expensive data-collection operations. This also possible to check the
 complete Debian archive for bugs, in a reasonable time.
 .
 This package is useful for all people who want to check Debian 
 packages for compliance with Debian policy. Every Debian maintainer
 should check packages with this tool before uploading them to the
 archive.
 .
 This version of Lintian is calibrated for policy version 3.6.1.
