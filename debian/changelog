  * Emit missing-build-dependency for packages that do not use debhelper
    but use specific parts of dh-autoreconf without build-depending on it.
  * Revert merging our two CI pipeline stages. Whilst this avoided an
    additional ~5 minute initial setup/teardown time, it meant that the
    cache misses attempted to do both the within the 1h timeout. Whilst we
    might still timeout overall, at least with a split we are very likely

  * Add the changelog-distribution-does-not-match-changes-file tag to the
    ftp-master-auto-reject profile
  * In Lintian::Collect::Source, use a centralized version parser.
  * Add new tag 'license-file-listed-in-debian-copyright' to avoid
    unnecessary clutter.
  * Fix command-line processing for --check-part so 'all' can also be part
    of a list.
  * Associate the multiline-field tag with the 'lintian' check.

    /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages as these files aren't supposed to be
    called as scripts. (Closes: #933167)
  * Avoid a large number of false-positives for

    + [BR] Detect dbgsym package in control file.  (Closes: #858117).
    + [BR] Warn about obsolete -dbg package.
  * checks/cruft.{desc,pm}:
    + [BR] Document long line tagged source-is-missing as a feature
      not a bug.  (Closes: #849470).
    + [BR] Correct a typo in description of tag
      license-problem-convert-utf-code.
    + [BR] Avoid a false positive in gfdl file detection.
    + [NT] Drop tags about outdated autotools config.guess and
      config.sub files.  These days debhelper automatically updates
      them when people use the dh-sequencer and the check is not
      geared for more thorough analysis.  (Closes: #848878)
    + [CL] Check that README.source is not the dh_make template.
      (Closes: #633850)
  * checks/debian-readme.{desc,pm}:
    + [NT] Locate the README.Debian using the index rather than relying
      on a collection.
  * checks/fields.pm:
    + [BR] Enforce naming convention for debug package.  (Closes: #645455).
    + [NT] Avoid proposing "/git/git/" as a part of the canonical URL for
      anonscm.debian.org.  Thanks to Andreas Beckmann for spotting the
      bug.  (Closes: #851215)
    + [NT] Apply patch from Dylan Aïssi to recommend "javascript" section
      for libjs packages.  Previously, lintian would recommend "web".
      (Closes: #863386)
  * checks/files.pm:
    + [BR] Do not report duplicates for package-installs-apt-preferences
      and package-installs-apt-sources.  (Closes: #814521).
    + [NT] Apply patch from Helmut Grohne to detect some possible invalid
      uses of "Multi-Arch: foreign".  (Closes: #856975)
    + [NT] Improve the empty-binary-package tag by adding more common
      files that should be ignored.  Thanks to Helmut Grohne for all the
      research behind it.  (Closes: #856857)
    + [BR] Detect symlink pointing to builddir.  (Closes: #860419)
    + [CL] Detect RData without README.source.  (Closes: #815233)
    + [NT] Remove work around for segmentation faults in t1disasm from
      t1utils (<< 1.38-4~).  Given Jessie is the minimum supported Debian
      version, we can now assume t1utils to be (>= 1.38-4).
  * checks/gir.{desc,pm}:
    + [NT] Add check for gir packages written by Simon McVittie.
      (Closes: #695345)
  * checks/init.d.{desc,pm}:
    + [NT] Remove check for init.d scripts accessing /usr without a
      $remote_fs dependency as /usr must now be mounted by the initramfs.
      (Closes: #829649)
  * checks/menu-format.{desc,pm}:
    + [NT] Update the reference to Desktop Entry Specification to point
      to version 1.1.
    + [NT] Apply patch from Laurent Bigonville to check desktop files
      for missing "Icon" field.  (Closes: #854132)
  * checks/rules.{desc,pm}:
    + [NT] Drop "package-would-benefit-from-build-arch-targets".  The
      dpkg-buildpackage refuses to build packages that trigger this tag.
      Also, the tag implies two other "W" tags so contributors are still
      notified of a potential problem.
    + [CL] Check for manual parsing of dpkg-parsechangelog output now that
      we have /usr/share/dpkg/pkg-info.mk.
  * checks/scripts.{desc,pm}:
    + [NT] Apply patch from Christopher Hoskin to except -doc packages
      from the "new-package-should-not-package-python2-module" tag.

      maintainer scripts.

    + [NT] Apply patch from Michael Biebl to warn about deprecated
      "BindTo" option in systemd service files.  (Closes: #857194)

      packagers to create an autopkgtest for their package.
      (Closes: #859467)
    + [NT] Fix false-positive "missing-runtime-test-file" when the
      "Tests-Directory" field is set to a single dot.  Thanks to
      Ian Jackson for reporting the issue.  (Closes: #849880)
  * checks/triggers.{desc,pm}:
    + [NT] New check.  (Closes: #698723)
  * checks/upstream-metadata.pm:
    + [JW, NT] Disable YAML parsing of upstream metadata file as the YAML
      parser executes code.  (Closes: #861958, CVE-2017-8829)
  * checks/watch-file.pm:
    + [NT] Apply patch from Alexander Kulak to handle whitespace correctly
      in the options in v4 watch files.  (Closes: #861599)

  * coll/debian-readme{,desc}:
    + [NT] Remove.  Merge what little functionality it offers into the
      debian-readme check.

  * commands/{lintian => lintian.pm}:
    + [NT] Turn the lintian frontend into a dplint command module to avoid
      code duplication.
  * commands/reporting-*:
    + [NT] Rewrite the config file handling.  The reporting framework now
      uses a YAML configuration file instead of a perl script.
    + [NT] Support processing packages from multiple archives and different
      suites in these archives.  This enables lintian.d.o to also process
      dbgsym packages.  (Closes: #856312)

  * data/changes-file/known-dists:
    + [NT] Add buster and remove squeeze.

    + [NT] Add new "Testsuite-Restrictions" field.

      for the suggestion.  (Closes: #858326)
  * data/scripts/maintainer-script-bad-command:
    + [NT] Remove check for suidregister, dpkg --assert-working-epoch, and
      dpkg --assert-multi-conrep.  None of these trigger any tags in the
      archive any longer and the (new) features have been available for
      8+ years.

    + [NT] Apply patches from Edward Betts to fix bugs in the correction
      word lists.  (Closes: #852005, #852084)
    + [NT] Apply patch from Edward Betts to remove corrections for

      spellings in AU.  (Closes: #852145)
    + [EB] Add some more spelling corrections.  (Closes: #852369, #852404,
      #852407, #852409, #852410, #852411, #852413, #852414, #852416,

      date.

      Wheezy.
    + [NT] Mention Debian Policy v4.0.0 in the description.

    + [NT] Remove fallback code for "old" style "pm"-less checks.

    + [NT] Update to support multiple archives.

  * t/runtests:
    + [NT] Re-sort test output after running the "post_test" sed script
      on the output.  This prevent test failures caused by the order
      changing on different architectures prior to the sed script is run

      correctly).
  * t/tests/cruft-general-upstream/pre_upstream:
    + [EB] Fix failing tests by making the fake flash object more
      convincing.  The most recent version of libmagic uses a more precise

  * lib/Lintian/Check.pm:
    + [NT] Optimise out some calls to Lintian::Data, which in
      a few cases adds up to a couple of seconds in total
      runtime.

      longer exists.

    + [NT] Add a --[no-]generate-reports option as alias of
      the -r mode.  The option can now be used together with
      "-i", "-f" or "-c" to control whether the reports
      should generated at the end of the run.  Without any
      of these, harness will only generate reports like it
      used to do.
  * reporting/templates/*.tmpl:
    + [NT] Change from XHTML 1.1 to HTML5.

    + [NT] Apply patch from Tomasz Buchert to add "timestamp"

  * debian/control:
    + [NT] Recommend dpkg (>= 1.17.14) for the --ctrl-tarfile
      option in dpkg-deb.  Lintian relies on it to support

    + [AB] Add contributors from 2014 and 2015.

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [NT] Produce a better error message for lintian detects
      that a check has a dependency on an unknown collection.

  * helpers/coll/objdump-info-helper:
    + [NT] Apply patch from Matt Kraai that adjusts the regex
      used for parsing readelf output.  Thanks to Martin Pitt
      for reporting the issues.  (Closes: #771054)

  * lib/Lintian/Collect/Binary.pm:
    + [NT] Add "debug" class for "is_pkg_class".  This uses the
      package name to guess if the package is expected to
      contain debug symbols.
  * lib/Lintian/Command.pm:
    + [NT] Use croak() rather than L::Util's fail() on errors.
      The issues are generally not "internal errors".
  * lib/Lintian/Internal/FrontendUtil.pm:
    + [NT] Work around a bug in autodie, where an fdopen of a
      file-descriptor always failed with "bad file descriptor".
  * lib/Lintian/Lab.pm:
    + [NT] Null fields extra metadata fields in the lab storage
      that are no longer used.  These were previously used by
      the reporting framework.
    + [NT] Automatically correct lab metadata, when the lab
      discovers an entry does not exist.  Any remains of the
      entry will be removed as well.  Previously, the lab would
      just throw an error and require a manual correction of
      the lab.
  * lib/Lintian/Reporting/ResourceManager.pm:
    + [NT] Only preserve the last extension of the installed
      resource.  Previously it would keep all "extensions",
      including long parts of the original name if it happened
      to contain a period.
  * lib/Lintian/Util.pm:
    + [NT] Prefer dpkg-deb --ctrl-tarfile to "ar p" when dpkg
      is recent enough.
    + [NT] Stricten the permitted whitespace at the end of GPG
      marker lines.  This is the same issue as CVE-2015-0840,
      except lintian never attempted to validate the signature.
    + [NT] Explicitly use YAML::XS for reading and writing
      YAML files.  YAML::Any does not specify an interface for
      reliably read YAML files in UTF-8 encoding leading to
      "mojibake" in some cases.  Thanks to Andreas Rönnquist
      for reporting the issue.  (Closes: #784639)

  * profiles/ubuntu/main.profile:
    + [BR] Exclude no-human-maintainers (Closes: #769036).

  * reporting/config:
    + [NT] Include and briefly document new configuration
      options.
  * reporting/{harness,html_reports}:
    + [NT] Rewrite harness and remove the hard dependency on
      a functional permanent laboratory in the reporting
      framework.
      - The framework now relies on the "harness state cache"
        (a YAML file), which can be updated atomically.
      - The harness framework now avoids stat(2)ing all
        artefacts on the mirror just to check if they are
        unchanged.
      - The harness frontends use less memory and now
        releases most of it before calling html_reports.
        This should reduce the peak memory requirements
        considerably for the html_reports part of the run.
  * reporting/{html_reports,templates/*}:
    + [NT] Reorder the datastructures shared with templates
      for better data sharing.  This reduces the memory
      consumption of html_reports by ~25% on lintian.d.o.
  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [NT] Templates are now always read and (their output)
      written in the UTF-8 encoding.
    + [NT] Stop reading $statistics_file from the config file.

      related issues.  (Closes: #762609)

      canonicalize subroutine.  (Closes: #766468)

  * collection/{bin-pkg-control,unpacked}:
    + [NT] Pass "-m" to tar to make it avoid "correcting" the
      timestamp of the extracted files.  Lintian does not need
      it for correctness, so it can make tar save a few syscalls
      here.
    + [NT] Explicitly pass tar options to make it extract files
      as the current user and applying the users umask.  This is
      mostly to be explicit about how things are extracted.

      "LINTIAN_" (and a select few well known variables) are
      preserved.
    + [NT] Runtime for collections and checks now only requires
      a single --debug option.  Lintian will now also show
      runtime for other things (e.g. total runtimes).
    + [NT] Add --perf-debug and --perf-output options to enable
      logging for performance data.  This is mostly intended
      to allow collecting performance data from archive-wide
      runs.
    + [NT] Hide some options in the default output for --help.
      These can now be shown with "--help=extended".
    + [NT] Add a new "Developer/special usage options" section
      in the --help output for some options (e.g. --debug).
      This section is hidden by default.

  * lib/Lintian/Relation.pm:
    + [NT] Unparsable entries are now included in relation
      objects rather than being silently discarded.

    + [NT] Purge even more ENV variables in clean_env.

      input file descriptors to one or more output file
      descriptors.

  * man/lintian.pod.in:
    + [NT] Document the performance logging options.
    + [NT] Add a new "Developer/special usage options" section
      in the --help output for some options (e.g. --debug).

  * private/generate-html-docs:
    + [NT] Add doctype and encoding to generated files.

  * reporting/harness:

  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [NT] Correct the command line in the creation of the
      lintian.log.gz.
  * reporting/{html_reports,templates/*}:
    + [NT] Correct the generated HTML, which was invalid in
      some cases.
  * reporting/templates/{head,lintian.css}.tmpl:
    + [NT] Define a default "viewport".  This slightly improves
      the output on some mobile devices.
    + [NT] Add some special cases for "smaller" viewports in the
      style sheet.
  * reporting/templates/maintainer.tmpl:
    + [NT] Correct name of variable to avoid using an undefined
      variable.

  * vendors/ubuntu/main/data/changes-file/known-dists:
    + [NT] Add "vivid" per request of Iain Lane.

      and "menu-files" collections.
  * checks/changes-file.pm:
    + [NT] Add "-lts" as common suffix for distribution,
      which makes "squeeze-lts" a valid distribution.  Thanks
      to Holger Levsen for the report.  (Closes: #763339)
  * checks/description.pm:
    + [SL] show the actual description when it is too short.
  * checks/files.pm:

      useless.  Thanks to Mathieu Malaterre for reporting.
      (Closes: #762660)
  * checks/patch-systems.pm:
    + [NT] Rewrite using index rather than debfiles to analyse
      the package.  A side-effect of that means that Lintian
      can now check patches stored in the upstream part of the
      packages.  (Closes: #563773)
  * checks/po-debconf.pm:
    + [NT] Avoid writing test.pot to the unpacked package.
      (Closes: #699022)
  * checks/testsuite.pm:
    + [NT] Recognise autopkgtest-pkg-{perl,ruby} values for
      the "Testsuite" field.  Extended validation is not
      implemented though.  Thanks to Niko Tyni for reporting
      the issue.  (Closes: #762177)

  * collection/*:
    + [NT] Remove all uses of "debfiles" and "control".
  * collection/{debfiles,doc-base-files,init.d,menu-files}{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Deprecated, will be removed in a future release.

  * data/*:
    + [NT] Refresh some of the data against unstable.
  * data/cruft/non-free-license:
    + [BR] Detect cc-by-nc-sa license.  (Closes:  #749768).
  * data/standards-version/release-dates:
    + [NT] Add 3.9.6.  (Closes: #762460)

  * debian/control:
    + [NT] Bump Standards-Versions to 3.9.6 - no changes
      required.

    + [NT] Stop installing /var/spool/lintian
  * debian/lintian.install:
    + [NT] Install Lintian::Tutorial POD documents into
      /usr/share/perl5.  (Closes: #761930)
  * debian/postinst:
    + [NT] Remove empty Lintian labs in /var/spool/lintian on
      upgrade.
  * debian/postrm:
    + [NT] Remove the "changes" folder when purging the

    + [NT] Mention "safe_qx" as alternative to qx/`` in the
      tutorial.

  * lib/Lintian/Collect{,/*}.pm:
    + [NT] Deprecate the use of "control", "debfiles" and
      "unpacked".  Consumers are recommended to use
      index_resolved_path and control_index_resolved_path
      instead.
    + [NT] Remove all uses of debfiles (both the method and
      the collection).  All methods (except "debfiles") now
      depend on "unpacked" instead.
    + [NT] Remove all uses of the "control" and the "unpacked"
      method.
  * lib/Lintian/Command.pm:
    + [NT] Add support for running a sub in the child before
      it calls exec.
    + [NT] Add support for shell-like (e.g. &2) redirects of
      stdout and stderr.
    + [NT] Add safe_qx sub for replacing qx() that supports
      most of the features of spawn().
  * lib/Lintian/Path.pm:
    + [NT] Add support for fetching and (where it makes sense)
      opening the underlying file system object.  It also adds
      a few minor safety guards to common issues with symlinks.
      (Closes: #698930)
  * lib/Lintian/Path/FSInfo.pm:
    + [NT] New file.

  * reporting/*:
    + [NT] Avoid forking a shell when invoking commands.  This
      has the side effect of allowing some paths from the
      configuration to contain spaces (among other), where it
      previously would not work.
  * reporting/templates/maintainer.tmpl:
    + [NT] Use https:// in links to other resources/sites and
      add link to tracker.debian.org.

    + [NT] Deal with parsing an ambiguous override a bit better.  This
      solves false-positive malformed-override, where Lintian misparsed
      the tag name as a package name.  (Closes: #699628)
  * lib/Lintian/Util.pm:
    + [NT] Reject partially signed Deb822 files.  Most Deb822 files
      are not signed at all; but those that are should be completely
      covered by a signature.  (Closes: #696230)
    + [ADB] Fix a typo in the matching of expected delimiters for some
      signed messages; thanks Samuel Bronson.
    + [NT] Add sub to check if a path is contained within a given dir.
    + [NT] Fix bug in resolve_pkg_path that made it resolve some links
      incorrectly.
    + [NT] Document that resolve_pkg_path is not sufficient to test the
      "safeness" of a symlink.

    + [NT] Document that --pedantic is the same as "-L +=pedantic".
      (Closes: #703989)
    + [NT] Fix typo of the "override" variable in the config example.

  * private/refresh-locale-codes:
    + [JW,NT] Ignore the "zxx" locale code, which means "No
      linguistic content".  (Closes: #692548)

  * reporting/config:
    + [JP] Remove unused $GRAPH_DIR configuration option.
  * reporting/graphs/{statistics,tags}.gpi:
    + [JP] Tweak graph size to allow longer labels, and force font
      family.
  * reporting/harness:
    + [NT] Add --to-stdout option to emit log information to
      stdout as well as the log files.
    + [NT] Always schedule packages in groups.  Otherwise, binNMU'ed
      binaries would not be tested together with their source
      package (and architecture independent packages).
    + [NT] Schedule groups in chunks (default 512 per chunk).
      This makes the Lintian processes shorter and makes memory
      reclaimable sooner.  (Closes: #695839)
    + [NT] Remove "make-shift" lab-query support now that
      Lintian::Lab supports it.
  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [NT] Update xrefs to include source version.
    + [NT] Generate a text file suitable for Apache's RewriteMap to
      map source packages to the full report for that source.
      Thanks to Joerg "Ganneff" Jaspert for the suggestion to use
      RewriteMap.  (Closes: #696960)
    + [JP] Fix version labels glitches.
    + [JP] Use global $GRAPHS_RANGE_DAYS.
    + [JP] Pass graph variables to index and tag templates.
  * reporting/lintian.css:
    + [JP] Tweak graph alignment.
  * reporting/templates/{packages,maintainer,tag}.tmpl:
    + [NT] Properly handle multiple versions of the same source and
      add versioned anchors to them.
  * reporting/templates/{index,tag}.tmpl:
    + [JP] Include history graphs in HTML templates.
  * reporting/templates/tag.tmpl:
    + [NT] Fix "empty <ul>" tag when tag has no "extra" information.
      Thanks to Vasudev Kamath for reporting the issue.

    + [NT] Add corrections for usage, invocation(s) and ancient.

  * debian/changelog:
    + [NT] raster-image-in-scalable-directory was added in 2.5.7,
      not removed.

  * frontend/lintian{,-info}:
    + [NT] Remove assumption that $ENV{HOME} is set/defined.  If
      $ENV{HOME} is not sent, user specific profiles will simply
      be ignored.
  * frontend/lintian:
    + [NT] Attempt to automatically determine what to process, if
      no packages are given and debian/changelog exists.  Thanks
      to Gilles Filippini for the suggestion.  (Closes: #676799)

  * lib/Lintian/Collect/Package.pm:
    + [NT] sorted_index now returns a list rather than a list ref.
    + [NT] Represent files (from index) as Lintian::Path objects.
  * lib/Lintian/Collect/Source.pm:
    + [NT] Recognise "Package-Type" as an alternative of the "X-"
      field of same name.  Thanks to Christian Perrier for the
      report.  (Closes: #677649)

lintian (2.5.8) unstable; urgency=low

  Its like 2.5.7, only with less false positives and no FTBFS.

  * checks/binaries{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Fix a too strict regex causing false-positives for
      biarch packages.  This was a regression introduced in
      version 2.5.7.  Thanks to Sven Joachim for reporting it.
      (Closes: #673106)
    + [NT] Demote certainty of hardening-no-stackprotector to
      wild-guess and move it to debian/extra-hardening profile.
    + [NT] Skip hardening-no-fortify-functions for binaries only
      using the unprotected memcpy.  This greatly reduces the
      number of false positives for binaries compiled with
      gcc-4.7 -O2 (or higher optimization).  (Closes: #673112)
  * checks/files:
    + [NT] Properly handle symlinks in icon directories.  Thanks
      to Nicholas Breen for the report and Felix Geyer for the
      patches.  (Closes: #673352)
    + [NT] Ignore wrong sizes on images in animations as it may
      be a method to implement the animation.  Thanks to Matthias
      Klumpp for the report and Felix Geyer for the patch.
      (Closes: #673862)
    + [NT] Ignore wrong icon sizes if the size difference is at
      most 2px.  Thanks to Felix Geyer for the patch.
  * checks/scripts:
    + [NT] Refactor the %versioned_interpreters into a new
      data file.
  * checks/shared-libs:
    + [NT] Fix false positive "dev-pkg-without-shlib-symlink"
      for shared libraries using "libtool -release X.Y".
      Thanks to Sven Joachim for the report.  (Closes: #673109)
    + [NT] Fix false positive "dev-pkg-without-shlib-symlink"
      for shared libraries installed in /lib.  Lintian now
      correctly expects the dev-symlink beneath /usr/lib.
      Thanks to Guillem Jover for the report.
  * checks/source-copyright:
    + [NT] Use the in-memory contents of the copyright file
      instead of re-reading the file when parsing it as a
      DEP-5 copyright file.

  * collection/objdump-info{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Drop -D flag for readelf when looking for symbols.
      This makes some checks more reliable in Ubuntu.  Thanks
      to Marc Deslauriers for the report and the patch.
      (Closes: #673451)

  * debian/control:
    + [NT] Add versioned Build-Depends on dpkg-dev (>= 1.16.1~)
      as the test suite relies on it.  Thanks to Luca Falavigna
      for reporting it.
    + [NT] Update the description to mention that the version
      of Lintian is calibrated for version 3.9.3 of the Policy.
  * debian/lintian.install:
    + [NT] Remove usr/share/lintian/data - Lintian does not
      need it and dpkg will not replace the dir with a symlink.

  * data/scripts/interpreters:
    + [NT] Add falcon, gbr3, jython and ngp2 as known interpreters.
      (Closes: #669911, #671387, #662134, #667895)
  * data/scripts/versioned-interpreters:
    + [NT] New file.
    + [NT] Added python2.7 to the list of known Python 2 interpreters.
  * data/spelling/corrections:
    + [RA] Remove corrections for "writeable" and "overwriteable".  These
      spellings are permitted by the OED in UK English.  (Closes: #673611)
    + [NT] Add correction for "pointer".

  * lib/Lintian/Collect/*.pm:
    + [NT] Localize "$_" to avoid truncating caller's variable.
      (Closes: #673613)

  * t:
    + [NT] Generate empty ".so" files used in the test.  This
      resolves an issue where dpkg-source would exclude them
      causing a FTBFS.  (Closes: #673198)
    + [NT] Fix test failure in derivatives where some hardening
      flags are enabled by default.  Thanks to Marc Deslauriers
      for the report and the patch.  (Closes: #673449)

  * checks/*:
    + [NT] Remove some old tags that are no longer useful.
      (Closes: #663516)
    + [NT] Migrate to sorted_index from sorted_file_info.
    + [NT] Explicitly import needed subs from L::Util.
  * checks/apache2{,.desc}:
    + [NT] New files to check for apache2 related packages.  Thanks
      to Arno Töll and Stefan Fritsch for the patches.
      (Closes: #668546)
    + [NT] This check is not enabled by default.  It can be used
      via the debian/extra-apache2 profile.
  * checks/binaries{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Move embedded library data to a data file.
    + [NT] Add ELF hardening checks.  Thanks to Kees Cook for
      report and the patches.  (Closes: 650536)
    + [NT] Replace architecture tables with data files.
    + [JW] Check for missing Python3 numpy ABI dependency.
      (Closes: #671024)

      tag.  Thanks to Arno Töll for the report.  (Closes: #657402)
  * checks/changes-file{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Remove Ubuntu specific handling of distribution names.
      Instead replace it with a more generalized one that derivatives
      can reuse by extending vendor specific data files.  Thanks to
      Daniel Dehennin for the suggestion.  (Closes: #648777)
  * checks/control-file:
    + [NT] Rewrote parts to use Lintian::Collect for fetching data.

    + [NT] Remove logic for checking if a deb is meant for
      Ubuntu.  Instead unconditionally emit the tag and let the
      vendor profiles handle it.
  * checks/debconf:
    + [NT] Special case debconf providers for purge-debconf tag.
      Generally they cannot use db_purge in postrm (for obvious
      reasons), so the tag will be a false-positive in such
      cases.
  * checks/fields{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Add devref reference.

      "original-maintainer".  This field is now handled by vendor
      specific data files.  (Closes: #649852)

      release candidate versions.  For non-native packages, this

      their additional suggestions.  (Closes: #649277)
  * checks/filename-length.desc:
    + [ADB, NT] Reword description of package-has-long-file-name.

      raster images in "scalable" icon directories.  Thanks to
      Paul Wise for the report and Felix Geyer for the patches.
      (Closes: #628189)
  * checks/group-checks:

      javadoc jars.  Thanks to Ludovic Claude for the patch.
      (Closes: #660845)
  * checks/lintian.desc:
    + [NT] Updated the description of the override tags.
  * checks/manpages{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Detect hyphen used as minus sign following a groff \f[C] font
      change.  Thanks, Iustin Pop.  (Closes: #664471)
  * checks/menu-format:
    + [NT] Move menu section lists into a data file.
    + [NT] If a package is missing a menu icon, check its direct strong
      dependencies built from the same source (if any) for the icon.
      This fixes false-positives menu-icon-missing in some cases.
  * checks/menus{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Remove "manual" lazy load of data file.
  * checks/nmu:
    + [NT] Remove Ubuntu specific code to handle their (lack of) NMUs.
      These tags are instead suppressed by the Ubuntu profile.
  * checks/rules:
    + [NT] Fix false-positive "ignores-make-clean-error" tag caused by
      using make with -C and a dir containing the letter "i".  Thanks to
      Tobias Hansen for the report.  (Closes: #671537)
  * checks/scripts{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Mention devref 6.4 in command-with-path-in-maintainer-script.
      Thanks to Arno Töll for the patch.
    + [NT] Do not emit unusual-interpreter if the package provides the
      interpreter itself.
    + [NT] Ignore the lack of exec bit on the debconf shell modules.
  * checks/standards-version.desc:
    + [NT] Add references to the Policy upgrading checklist.  Thanks to

  * checks/*:
    + [NT] Fixed assumptions about certain fields being present.

  * checks/binaries{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Allow libnss_* plugins in usr/lib.
    + [JW] Check for ELF binaries installed in unsafe paths in
      Multi-Arch: same packages.  (Closes: #650445)

  * checks/control-file{,.desc}:

      checkout or unpacked source dir.  Based on patch from Evan
      Broder.  (Closes: #650701)

      Lintian::Profile.
    + [NT] Always load a profile.
    + [NT] Allow TMPDIR in the configuration file.
    + [NT] Treat "pedantic" as a normal severity.  In previous
      release, pedantic tags were not affected by --display-level.
      A side-effect of this is that "pedantic" can no longer be
      used with "display-level" in the configuration file.
    + [NT] Produce a better error message when asked to process an
      URL or a path that is definitely not a valid lab query.
      Thanks to Nicholas Bamber for the report.  (Closes: #651332)

      field/file/text.
  * lib/Lintian/CheckScript.pm:
    + [NT] New file.
  * lib/Lintian/Collect/{Binary,Source}.pm:

      as replacement for objdump.

    + [NT] Made direct_dependencies properly handle udebs.  This fixes
      an error that would cause lintian to skip some checks for udebs.
  * lib/Lintian/Collect/Package.pm:
    + [NT] Map an owner/group of "0/0" to "root/root".  This avoids a
      number of false-positive ownership tags if only numerical
      ownership is available in the tarball.  Thanks to Thorsten
      Glaser for the report.  (Closes: #638278)
  * lib/Lintian/Collect/Source.pm:

      being from "main", even if their "section" field implied
      otherwise.
  * lib/Lintian/Lab/Entry.pm:
    + [NT] Properly strip whitespace when loading collection status.
  * lib/Lintian/Processable/Package.pm:
    + [NT] Use part of the file name as package name if the mandatory
      "Package" or "Source" fields are missing rather than choking.
  * lib/Lintian/Profile.pm:
    + [NT] Catch recursively defined profiles when the Profile field
      contains a (slightly) different name than the Extends field of
      its parent.  (Closes: #655469)
    + [NT] Handle loading of checks and tags.
  * lib/Lintian/Tag/Info.pm:
    + [NT] Accepted patch from Evan Broder to always output effective
      severity in tag descriptions.

      unknown architectures and for "arch:all" packages.
    + [NT] Use a Profile to determine if a tag is suppressed or not.
    + [NT] Handle "pedantic" like the other severities.
    + [NT] Count experimental tags as a separate group of tags.  This
      fixes an issue where lintian would exit 1 if the only error
      tags emitted were experimental.  (Closes: #658971)
  * lib/Util.pm:
    + [NT] Create clean_env function to handle cleaning of the
      environment for children processes and finding a suitable UTF-8
      locale (when needed).

  * private/refresh-hwcap:
    + [JW] New file.

  * profiles/debian/ftp-master-auto-reject.profile:
    + [NT] Refreshed.

    + [NT] Removed useless "TODO" message from the log output.
    + [NT] Added -h/--help option to print usage information.
    + [NT] Added --dry-run option.
    + [NT] A source package is now only processed if one (or more) of
      its binaries are processed as well.
    + [NT] Also symlink $LINTIAN_BIN_DIR/gpgv to /bin/true when
      skipping signature checks.  This avoids issues when some tools
      prefers gpgv to gpg.

    + [NT] Refreshed.
  * data/debhelper/alt-dh_commands:
    + [NT] Renamed to dh_commands-manual.
  * data/debhelper/dh_commands-manual:
    + [NT] Support arbitrary dependency relations.  This new change
      also fixes a "duplicate" in the dependency output.
      (Closes: #643716)
  * data/fields/essential:
    + [NT] Add libc-bin to the list of known essential packages.
  * data/fields/obsolete-packages:
    + [NT] Added dpatch per request of the maintainer.  Thanks to
      Gergely Nagy for the report.  (Closes: #646420)
  * data/fields/virtual-packages:
    + [NT] Refreshed against sid.  Thanks to Gregor Herrmann for the
      report.  (Closes: #646604)
  * data/rules/deprecated-makefiles:
    + [JW] Added dbs makefiles, since dbs maintainer deprecated the
      package in 0.47.  (Closes: #646126)
  * data/shared-libs/ldconfig-dirs:
    + [NT] Add multi-arch dirs for hurd-i386.  Thanks to Julien
      Cristau for noticing that they were missing.
  * data/spelling/corrections:
    + [NT] Added a correction for "propagate" and "separate", thanks
      to Guillem Jover for the suggestions.
      (Closes: #644793, #646529)
    + [JW] Added a number of corrections.  (Closes: #645393)

  * debian/control:
    + [CW] Mark lintian Multi-Arch: foreign (there does exist one
      Architecture: any package that Build-Depends: lintian, so this helps
      multiarch cross-building slightly).
  * debian/lintian.install:
    + [NT] Removed unpack which was removed.

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [NT] Collections explicitly requested (by -U) are no longer
      auto-removed.  Previously the only way to prevent auto-removal
      was to use --keep-lab.
    + [NT] Removed all archive-wide testing code.  This has been moved
      into reporting/harness.  This deprecates a lot options and config
      variables (--arch, --archivedir, --area, --dist, --section and
      LINTIAN_{ARCH,ARCHIVEDIR,AREA,DIST}).
    + [NT] Support new lab query format, replacing the old "package
      name"-based search.

  * lib/Lab{,/Package}.pm:
    + [NT] Removed, replaced by Lintian::Lab{,::Entry}.
  * lib/Lintian/Check.pm:
    + [JW] Merged with common_data.pm.
  * lib/Lintian/Collect/Group.pm:
    + [NT] New file - Collect like API for group data.
  * lib/Lintian/Collect/Source.pm:
    + [JW] Fixed call to binary_field in binary_relation.
      (Closes: #641609)
  * lib/Lintian/Data.pm:
    + [NT] Fixed a file descriptor leak.
  * lib/Lintian/Lab{,/Entry,/Manifest,/ManifestDiff}.pm:
    + [NT] New files.  Replaces the Read_pkglists, Lab and
      Lab::Package modules.
  * lib/Lintian/Lab.pm:
    + [JW,NT] Correctly handle $TMPDIR not being an absolute path.
      (Closes: #642113)
    + [NT] New lab layout style resembling the "pool" dirs of the
      Debian mirrors.  This allows more than 32 000 packages of a
      given type in the laboratory.  It also allows multiple
      versions/architectures of the same package in static labs.
      A feature previously only enabled in temporary labs.  The new
      layout is incompatible with the old format.  (Closes: #641468)
  * lib/Lintian/Output.pm:
    + [NT] Minor refactoring to simplify creation of the FullEWI
      module.
  * lib/Lintian/Output/FullEWI.pm:
    + [NT] New experimental output.  More machine-friendly version
      of the normal Lintian output format.
  * lib/Lintian/Output/XML.pm:
    + [NT] Use self-closing tags (if possible) and do not write
      attributes with an empty value.
  * lib/Lintian/Processable.pm:
    + [NT] Reduced to an abstract class.  The "old" implementation
      has been put into Lintian::Processable::Package.
  * lib/Lintian/Processable/Package.pm:
    + [NT] New file.
    + [NT] Changed the "name" of changes files.  It is now equal to
      the name of the source package.  Previously it was the filename
      (without extension and without the dir part).
  * lib/Read_pkglists.pm:
    + [NT] Removed - replaced by Lintian::Lab::Manifest.
  * lib/Util.pm:
    + [NT] Stricten the parser to not accept a field name with a ":".
      This could cause the parser to eat the first part of the value,
      if it contained a colon and there was no space before the value.
      Thanks to Pino Toscano for reporting the issue.
    + [JW] Explicitly check that files are not encoded using ISO-2022,
      when they should be encoded with UTF-8.  (Closes: #643009)
    + [JW] Use "paragraph" and "field" rather than "section" and "tag"
      when referring to a Debian control file.

  * man/lintian.pod.in:
    + [NT] Fixed a typo, thanks to Evgeni Golov for spotting it,

  * private/generate-lintian-pod:
    + [NT] Document which collections are auto-removed by default in
      static labs.

  * profiles/ubuntu/main.profile:
    + [NT] Disable no-upstream-changelog and lzma-deb-archive for
      Ubuntu.  Thanks to Evan Broder for the report and patch.
      (Closes: #648117)

  * reporting/*:
    + [NT] Recognise and display pedantic tags.
    + [JW] Only emit "plus X overrides" if there any overrides.
  * reporting/{harness,html_reports}:
    + [NT] Do not accept LINTIAN_UNPACK_LEVEL nor LINTIAN_SECTION
      anymore.  The lintian frontend lost support for these in
      2.5.0~rc3.
  * reporting/harness:
    + [NT] Refactored to handle the archive-wide checking directly.
    + [NT] Use the new FullEWI output format for the archive-wide
      logs.
  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [NT] Ensure source tags appear before binary tags.
      (Closes: #580945)
    + [NT] Supports the FullEWI output format.

  * t/*:
    + [NT] Skip some tests broken by a recent dpkg upload.
      (Closes: #643205)

  * unpack/*:
    + [NT] Removed, no longer used.

  * checks/*:
    + [NT] Dropped fields from Needs-Info, it is no longer needed.
    + [JW] Use LC_ALL rather than LANG, since LC_ALL overrules
      LANG.  (Closes: #637595)
    + [JW] Removed all whitespace lines to avoid confusing some
      dctrl parsers (notably grep-dctrl).  (Closes: #639928)
    + [JW] Fix a number of broken references in the tag
      descriptions.  (Closes: #639923)
    + [JW] Rewrote Debian Bug references using #nnnnnn notation.
  * checks/binaries.desc:
    + [NT] Remove the reference to the Library Packaging Guide,
      since it is no longer available (in Debian).  (Closes: #640228)
  * checks/changelog-file{,.desc}:
    + [JW] Remove debmake-specific tag in favour of more general
      debian-changelog-file-contains-invalid-email-address.
      (Closes: #639946)
    + [JW,NT] Fixed use of uninitialized value as hash key.
      (Closes: #640238)
    + [NT] Mention that the missing native changelog tag can, in
      some cases, be emitted if it does not look like a Debian
      changelog.
  * checks/{conffile,etcfiles}{,.desc}:
    + [JW] Merged etcfiles into conffile.  (Closes: #637590)
  * checks/conffile:

  * checks/description.desc:
    + [JW] Added references to some tags.  (Closes: #640853)
  * checks/duplicate-files{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Replace the exception for "__init__.py" files by excluding
      all empty files from the check.  The bug (#632789) only requests
      an exception for "empty __init__.py" files and generally empty
      files are unlikely to cause a serious size-waste.
  * checks/fields{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Mention that perl modules included in perl itself should
      be the first dependency if it is only included in the perl
      from experimental.  Thanks to Dominic Hargreaves for the

      ignore the surrounding "<>" for the rest of the homepage checks.
      (Closes: #640947)
    + [NT] Added check for Build-Depending on libdbX.Y-dev (and related
      packages.  Most packages should be able to use unversioned -dev
      packages.  Thanks to Ondřej Surý for the report and the initial

  * checks/files{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Added exceptions to "extra-license-file" for manpages,
      static libraries, .pc-, elf and pyshared-data-files.  This
      covers all the false-positives currently found in the liblicense
      package.  (Closes: #617901)
    + [NT] Ignore non-ELF files in multiarch paths, when checking for
      a missing pre-depends on multiarch-support.  Thanks to Sven
      Joachim for the report.  (Closes: #639735)

      within Vim runtime path.  (Closes: #640371)

      it is more accurate than diffstat for this.  (Closes: #640131)

    + [NT] Removed, no longer used.

      tags were not shown unless the relevant options were also

      settings (such as --display-info).  (Closes: #640694)
    + [NT] If both --verbose and --quiet is used together, then use
      the last of them to appear rather than "both at the same time".
      (Closes: #640366)

      (Closes: #640489)

      output.
    + [JW] Parse "#nnnnnn" references as links to Debian bugs.
    + [NT] Check severity and certainty when loading checks.  This

    + [NT] New file.
  * lib/Lintian/Tags.pm:
    + [NT] Track which tags had overrides that have been dropped.

      in xhtml (xml), where all tags must be closed properly.
      (Closes: #639292)
    + [NT] Remove the last new line (if any) before a </pre> in tag
      to reduce the empty space to the next paragraph.

    + [JW] Use LC_ALL rather than LANG, since LC_ALL overrules
      LANG.
    + [JW] Stricten the DCtrl parser to choke on some syntax errors
      that were silently ignored.  (Closes: #639516)

  * man/lintian.pod.in:

      with --verbose or --debug.
    + [NT] Documented how --verbose and --quiet can be enabled via
      the config file.  Only one of "verbose" and "quiet" may
      appear in the config file.

    + [NT] Added lib/${MULTIARCH_DIR} to the list of paths to
      check for public shared libraries.  Thanks to Sven Joachim
      for the report and the patch.  (Closes: #630698)
    + [NT] Recognise .gox files as object files that cannot be
      stripped.  Thanks to Matthias Klose for the report.
      (Closes: #624521)
    + [NT] Do not assume that the architecture field is present.
    + [NT] Emit "arch-dependent-file-in-usr-share" and
      "binary-in-etc" also for static compiled files.  Thanks to
      Jakub Wilk for the report and the patch.  (Closes: #635354)
    + [NT] Fixed false-negative for rpath, if the rpath included
      the multi-arch dir.  Thanks to Jakub Wilk for the report and
      the patch.  (Closes: #637259)
  * checks/changelog-file:
    + [NT] Removed exception for symlinked changelogs if the
      package had an Ubuntu version.  This exception is now
      handled by the profile.  Thanks to Benjamin Drung for the
      heads up.
  * checks/circular-deps.desc:
    + [NT] Fixed typo; thanks to Nicolás Alvarez for the report
      and patch.  (Closes: #630925)
  * checks/control-files:
    + [NT] Refactored static tables into data-files.
  * checks/copyright-file:
    + [NT] Stricten one of the regexes for catching left over
      helper templates.  This should prevent false-positives for
      some license texts.  Thanks to Charles Plessy for the
      report.  (Closes: #631674)
    + [NT] Use group data to determine if a package is foreign
      or not for symlinked /usr/share/doc/<pkg> dirs.  This
      avoids the need for symlinks between packages in the
      lab.
  * checks/deb-format{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Allow data.tar.xz as the third member.  Thanks to
      Ansgar Burchardt for the report and patch.
      (Closes: #632556)
    + [NT] Added test for udebs having non-gzip data members,
      since the debian-installer does not support them.  Thanks
      to Luk Claes.  (Closes: #634874)
  * checks/debhelper:
    + [NT] Do not trigger deprecation warning for dh_python if it
      is followed by a "$".  This prevents false-positives when
      a Makefile variable is used to choose between dh_python2
      and dh_python3.  Thanks to Leonid Borisenko for the report.
      (Closes: #631662)
    + [NT] Do not trigger deprecation warning for dh_python-ply,
      which Lintian incorrectly identified as dh_python.  Thanks
      to Daniele Tricoli for the report.  (Closes: #632693)
    + [NT] Fix a broken regex that caused Lintian skip brace
      expansion checks for some debhelper files.  Thanks to
      Jakub Wilk for the report and the patch.  (Closes: #632883)
    + [NT] Do not consider "debian/debhelper" a temporary debhelper
      file.  Some packages uses this a directory to store their
      debhelper files.
  * checks/debian-source-dir{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Added missing word in the tag description for
      git-patches-not-exported.
    + [NT] Fixed information disclosure issue, where Lintian could
      be tricked into disclosing the present of files on the host
      system via specially crafted source packages.
  * checks/duplicate-files:
    + [NT] Exclude  __init__.py files from the check as they are
      required even if they are empty.  Thanks to Daniele Tricoli
      for the report.  (Closes: #632789)
    + [NT] Report duplicate changelogs as a separate tag.
  * checks/fields:
    + [NT] Refactored to use Lintian::Data and use new data files
      from data/fields.
    + [NT] Added python3-dev and removed python2.{4,5} from
      $PYTHON_DEV.  Thanks to Jakub Wilk for the report and the
      patch.  (Closes: #633044)
    + [NT] Fixed a bug where the libdb1-compat tag only triggered
      if libdb1-compat was listed in Pre-Depends.
    + [NT] Updated list of python "dev" packages.  Thanks to
      Jakub Wilk for the patch.
  * checks/filename-length{,.desc}:
    + [NT] New file that checks the length of the package file
      names.  (Closes: #631656)
  * checks/files:
    + [NT] Check for embedded copies of the underscore javascript
      library.  Thanks to Jakub Wilk for report and the patch.
      (Closes: #631513)
    + [NT] Removed a leading slash from the filename part of the
      extra for python-debug-in-wrong-location.  Thanks to
      Jakub Wilk for the report and the patch.  (Closes: #631530)
    + [NT] Accepted patch from Marcelo Jorge Vieira to catch
      four additional embedded javascript libraries.
      (Closes: #635447)
    + [NT] Stricten the regex for finding .xvpics dirs.
    + [NT] Shipping a lintian override is no longer enough to
      make lintian consider the package for "non-empty".
  * checks/init.d{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Provide a separate tag for upstart-jobs not registered
      via update-rc.d in postinst.  This allows vendors (such as
      Ubuntu) to disable this tag for upstart-jobs only using the
      new vendor profiles.  While this would break overrides, all
      existing overrides appears to be for normal scripts rather
      than upstart-jobs.  (Closes: #631872)
  * checks/java{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Jar files containing clojure files are no longer
      considered to be codeless.
    + [NT] Exclude jar files in /usr/lib/xul{-ext,runner} from the
      "jar-not-in-usr-share" check.  (Closes: #635495)
    + [NT] Fixed a typo in a tag description.
  * checks/menu-format.desc:
    + [NT] Mentioned how to get rid of the CR characters in the
      desktop file.  Thanks to Jakub Wilk.
  * checks/nmu:
    + [NT] "LowThresholdNMU" will now work as an alternative to
      "NMU" in changelogs for suppressing
      changelog-should-mention-nmu.  Thanks to Jordi Mallach for
      the report.  (Closes: #620418)
  * checks/po-debconf:
    + [NT] Allow po-files with an "@modifier", which works with
      debconf (>= 1.5.34).  (Closes: #617905)
  * checks/rules:
    + [NT] Check included files in d/rules against a limited
      number of common makefile snippets, which are known not
      to implement all the required targets.  This prevents
      false negatives of missing targets.  Thanks to
      Jakub Wilk for the suggestion and the initial makefile
      list.  (Closes: #631711)
    + [NT] Warn about including the CDBS simple-patchsys and dpatch
      as they are both deprecated by source format 3.0 (quilt).
      Thanks to Nelson A. de Oliveira for reporting and Luk Claes
      for providing an initial patch.  (Closes: #624201)
    + [NT] Added check for using DEB_*FLAGS_{SET,APPEND} in d/rules.
      Thanks to Raphaël Hertzog for the report.  (Closes: #631786)
  * checks/scripts{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Removed perl-suid related tags as the package is no
      longer available and we have no known packages triggering
      the tags at the moment.  (Closes: #631432)
    + [NT] Added perl6/rakudo as a known interpreter.  Thanks to
      Alessandro Ghedini for the report and patch.  (Closes: #636354)
  * checks/shared-libs{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Fixed broken sentence.  Thanks to Norbert Preining for
      reporting the issue.
    + [NT] Applied patch from Peter Pentchev to correct the logic for
      testing for shlib-calls-exit.  (Closes: #633976)
    + [NT] Mention that some of the tags may be triggered due to the
      debhelper bug #204975.  Thanks to Jakub Wilk for the report.
      (Closes: #633853)
  * checks/symlinks:
    + [NT] Symlink checking extended to relative paths as well.
      (Closes: #217023)

  * collection/*:
    + [NT] Removed all Needs-Info on "fields" and all checks that
      used the "fields" dir (or files therein) to determine if the
      scripts had been called in the wrong dir.
  * collection/diffstat:
    + [NT] No longer unconditionally creates a diffstat file,
      since the Lintian::Collect interface will fall back to
      using /dev/null in its absence.
  * collection/fields:
    + [NT] Removed creation of cross package symlinks.  They have
      been replaced by the group information that checks are
      passed.
    + [NT] Deprecated it in favour of a smarter Lintian::Collect.
      It will be removed in a later release; for now it will just
      remove the "fields" directory in the lab.
  * collection/file-info:
    + [NT] Double check the output of file(1) when it says a ".gz"
      file is not gzip compressed.  This should reduce the number
      of false-positives gz-file-not-gzip tags.
      (Closes: #620289)
    + [NT] Open files before using chdir.  In the future unpacked
      may be a symlink.
  * collection/index{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Updated to handle source packages and with support for
      multi tarball source packages.

  * data/control-files/{,u}deb-permissions:
    + [NT] Added files.
  * data/fields/*:
    + [NT] Added new files based on data variables from checks/fields.
  * data/fields/obsolete-packages:
    + [NT] Added libdigest-sha1-perl on request of the Perl Team.
      Thanks to Salvatore Bonaccorso for the report and patch.
      (Closes: #635441)
  * data/fields/perl-provides:
    + [NT] Refreshed against perl 5.12.4.
  * data/files/standard-files:
    + [NT] Added file.
  * data/rules/{deprecated,known}-makefiles:
    + [NT] Added file.
  * data/spelling/corrections:
    + [RA] Remove discontiguous correction.  The OED lists this as valid.
      Thanks, Charles Plessy.  (Closes: #632159)
    + [NT] Added another correction for "specification".  Thanks to
      Jakub Wilk for the hint.  (Closes: #634222)
    + [NT] Added another correction for "development" and "misspelt".
      Thanks to Pino Toscano and Jakub Wilk for the suggestion.

  * debian/control:
    + [NT] Bumped debhelper version to 8.1.0 due to the build-arch and
      build-indep targets.  Thanks to Mark Hymers for the heads up and
      a patch.  (Closes: #632550)
    + [NT] Added Build-Depends on cdbs, it is needed for some of the
      tests.
    + [NT] Pruned the Uploaders list a bit.  We would like to thank
      Jeroen van Wolffelaar, Frank Lichtenheld and Marc 'HE'
      Brockschmidt for their work on Lintian in the past.
  * debian/lintian.install:
    + [NT] Added the profiles directory.
  * debian/rules:
    + [NT] Added target to update the profiles.

  * doc/lintian.xml:
    + [NT] Added information about the new Vendor profiles.
    + [NT] Improved various parts of the User Manual.  Especially
      mention that Lintian can be run on changes files and this
      processes all packages related to the changes file.
  * doc/lintianrc.example:
    + [NT] Added more sample options.

  * frontend/{lintian,lintian-info}:
    + [NT] Added profile support (new option --profile), please
      refer to the Lintian User Manual for more information.
  * frontend/lintian:
    + [NT] Ensure that all dependency collections of a check are
      loaded.  Previously Lintian would only load direct
      dependencies of a collection and assume that was enough.
    + [NT] Allow "verbose" to appear in the lintianrc file.
    + [NT] Added new "--packages-from-file" option.  Lintian will
      read packages from the file (one package per line) and process
      these.  Unlike "--packages-file" it allows its argument to be
      "-" for stdin and the format is simpler.
    + [NT] Deprecated "--packages-file" in favour of the new
      "--packages-from-file" option.
    + [NT] Allow "y" as short form of "yes" in the configuration file.
      Furthermore, ignore case when doing the check for boolean
      values.

  * lib/Lab.pm:
    + [NT] Removed $dist argument to lab creation, since we rely on
      LINTIAN_DIST being exported anyway.
    + [NT] Allow temporary labs to contain the same package twice if
      the version or/and architecture differs.  (Closes: #632115)
  * lib/Lab/Package.pm:
    + [NT] Symlink in all components of the source package when
      creating the source entry in the lab.  Also removed legacy
      code for using the old unpack scripts.
  * lib/Lintian/Collect/{Binary,Source}.pm:
    + [NT] Refactored code from these files into the module
      Lintian::Collect::Package.
  * lib/Lintian/Collect/Package.pm:
    + [NT] New file.  This serves as a base for Lintian::Collect
      modules that can be unpacked.
  * lib/Lintian/Command.pm:
    + [NT] Added support for appending output to files without
      truncating them first via the new out_append and
      err_append options.
  * lib/Lintian/Data.pm:
    + [NT] Let new take an optional fourth argument, a code sub,
      that can be used to pre-process the value.
  * lib/Lintian/{Internal/FrontendUtil,Profile}.pm:
    + [NT] New files.
  * lib/Lintian/ProcessablePool.pm:
    + [NT] Made the pool consider two packages with the same name
      as duplicates even if their version or architecture differs,
      when the underlying Lab does not support this run.  This
      causes lintian to drop one of the packages rather than ending
      up with an internal error.
  * lib/Lintian/{Tag/Info,Tags}.pm:
    + [NT] Updated for profile support.
  * lib/Read_pkglists.pm:
    + [NT] Merged the binary and udeb format since they were
      essentially the same.  Old udeb files can still be parsed
      as binary ones.

  * man/lintian.pod.in:
    + [NT] Documented the new --profile option.  Note that the
      options --suppress-tags{,-from-file} now suppresses tags
      in the active profile.
    + [NT] Removed all references to "unpack-level".  All unpack
      levels have been replaced by collections.
    + [NT] Clarified that some command-line arguments are only
      useful when using a static lintian lab.
    + [NT] Described the configuration file format.  Thanks to
      Sven Joachim for the report.  (Closes: #636681)
  * man/lintian-info.pod:
    + [NT] Documented the new --profile option.

  * profiles/*:
    + [NT] Added default profiles for Debian and Ubuntu.  Note
      that these profiles will silently ignore overrides for
      "fatal" (non-overridable) tags.  (Closes: #536364)

  * reporting/harness:
    + [NT] Use --packages-from-file instead of --packages-file.
  * reporting/{html_reports,templates/index.tmpl}:
    + [NT] Always emit a page for tags, even if they are not emitted.
      It will also include a link to the entire list of known tags.
      (Closes: #631763)
  * reporting/templates/{tag-not-seen,tags-all}.tmpl:
    + [NT] New files.

  * unpack/list-binpkg:
    + [NT] Added a -u option to make it fetch udebs instead of
      regular binaries.  This and the udeb/bin format merge makes
      list-udebpkg obsolete.
  * unpack/list-udebpkg:
    + [NT] Removed in favour of list-binpkg.
  * unpack/unpack-srcpkg-l1:
    + [NT] Removed in favour of the collection system.

lintian (2.5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Summary of tag changes:
    + Added:
      - bad-perm-for-file-in-etc-sudoers.d

      - dh_pycentral-is-obsolete
      - dh_python-is-obsolete
      - illegal-multi-arch-value
      - non-empty-dependency_libs-in-la-file
    + Removed:
      - uses-dh-python-with-no-pycompat
      - ldconfig-symlink-before-shlib-in-deb

  * checks/binaries:
    + [NT] Applied patch from Paul Wise to detect binaries embedding
      glee, glew and libtheora.  (Closes: #629288)
    + [NT] Also consider multiarch dirs when looking for public shared
      libraries.  (Closes: #630164)
  * checks/debhelper{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Recognise that dh_python and dh_pycentral are now obsolete.
      (Closes: #496902, #541978)
  * checks/changes-file:
    + [NT] Always verify the checksums of changes-files.
  * checks/copyright-file:
    + [NT] Extended current dh_make template checks.  Thanks to
      Nelson A. de Oliveira for the patch.  (Closes: #598412)
  * checks/fields{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Allow "all" and "any" to appear together in the Architecture
      field of a .dsc file.  (Closes: #626775)
    + [NT] Added illegal-multi-arch-value.  (Closes: #616493)
  * checks/files:
    + [NT] Fixed two misnamed udeb tags, which lead to an internal
      error if triggered.  Thanks to Guillem Jover for the report.
      (Closes: #628754)
    + [NT] Added bad-perm-for-file-in-etc-sudoers.d tag.
      (Closes: #588831)
    + [CW] Do not issue missing-pre-dependency-on-multiarch-support for
      udebs.
    + [NT] Limit missing-pre-dependency-on-multiarch-support to real
      files only.  Previously it would also check symlinks.
      (Closes: #629648)
  * checks/java{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Sort the jar files by name, so they are checked in the same
      order.
    + [NT] Improved the description of classpath-contains-relative-path.
      (Closes: #629189)
    + [NT] Reduced false-positives of classpath-contains-relative-path.
      Relative classpaths are now okay if they point to jar files in
      /usr/share/java (but not subdirs thereof) and there is a strong
      libX-java dependency.  Alternatively if the classpath points to
      a file or a symlink in the package itself, then it is also okay.
    + [NT] Allow maven plugins to be without classpaths.
      (Closes: #629056)
  * checks/manpages.desc:
    + [ADB] Don't suggest using debmake's output as a reference.  The
      package is not even in oldstable any more.
  * checks/md5sums.desc:
    + [ADB] Drop references to obsolete debstd.  Thanks to Steve Langasek
      for the pointer.
  * checks/rules:
    + [NT] Removed code for handling packages with dh_python.
    + [NT] Fixed the code for determining Build-Depends for python
      packages.  Thanks to Jakub Wilk for the patch.
      (Closes: #614876, #616553)
    + [NT] Applied patch from Roger Leigh to implement the check for
      rules files missing the build-arch and build-indep targets.
      (Closes: #605012)
  * checks/shared-libs{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Added non-empty-dependency_libs-in-la-file.  (Closes: #628673)
    + [NT] Removed ldconfig-symlink-before-shlib-in-deb.

  * collection/java:
    + [NT] Fixed a regex that would accept any file ending with "jar" to
      be a jar file rather than only accepting ".jar".  This fixes a
      number of false-positives java checks.
  * collection/unpacked:
    + [NT] Added support for unpacking source packages using libdpkg-perl,
      instead of dpkg-source, if the latter is not present.
      (Closes: #626476)

  * data/binaries/multiarch-dirs:
    + [NT] New file - maps architectures to multiarch dirs.
  * data/fields/{perl-provides,virtual-packages}:
    + [NT] Refreshed.  (Closes: #627082, #627431)
  * data/output/ftp-master-*:
    + [NT] Refreshed.
  * data/shared-libs/ldconfig-dirs:
    + [NT] Updated ldconfig path for i386 multiarch paths.  Thanks to
      Raphaël Hertzog for the reminder.
  * data/spelling/corrections-multiword:
    + [CW] Remove the "requires to" correction; it has too many common
      false positives, especially involving relative clauses.
      (Closes: #625886)

  * debian/control:
    + [NT] (Build-)Dependency changes.
      - xz-lzma is now preferred to lzma as Build-Dependency
      - Added depends on libdpkg-perl
      - Reduced dpkg-dev to a suggests, we can use libdpkg-perl as
        fallback.
      - Explicitly depends on bzip2 to always support bz2 source packages.
      - Added xz-utils as suggests - needed for .xz source packages.
  * debian/rules:
    + [NT] Added recommended targets build-arch and build-indep.

  * doc/lintian.xml:
    + [NT] Clarify that the package type is not listed in the output for
      binary packages.  (Closes: #629193)

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [NT] Allow some options to be put into the lintianrc file.
      (Closes: #460350)
    + [NT] Added --no-cfg option that can be specified if no config
      file should be read.
    + [NT] Deprecated --checksums (also known as --md5sums and -m).
      Lintian will now always verify the checksums in changes files.
      The options will be accepted with a warning for now, but may
      be removed in a later release.  (Closes: #629453)
    + [NT] Fixed an issue where fail was called before it was
      available.  Thanks to Toby Corkindale for the report.
      (Closes: #630560, LP: #797553)

  * lib/Lintian/Tag/Info.pm:
    + [NT] Output the name of the check and the type of the check
      along with the description of the tag.
  * lib/Lintian/Tags.pm:
    + [NT] Fixed a flaw in logic that gave incorrect results for
      architecture dependent overrides.  Thanks to Andreas Beckmann for
      the report and the patch.  (Closes: #626587)

  * man/lintian.pod.in:
    + [NT] Mentioned that --checksums and aliases are deprecated.

  * unpack/list-srcpkg:
    + [ADB] Don't rely on the order of fields in the Sources file.  The
      files produced by the Debian archive no longer follow the order
      which the code previously assumed, and we shouldn't assume that
      the order won't change again in the future.  (Closes: #626597)

      - extended-description-contains-empty-paragraph
      - git-patches-not-exported

  * checks/binaries:
    + [NT] Fixed false-positive embedded-library.  Lintian incorrectly
      assumed that none of these binary packages would contain a source
      version in their source field.  (Closes: #626038)
  * checks/copyright-file.desc:
    + [ADB] Correct a spelling mistake ("coypright" -> "copyright") in the
      description of copyright-refers-to-deprecated-bsd-license-file;
      thanks, Kees Cook.  (Closes: #623780)
  * checks/description{,.desc}:

  * checks/java:
    + [NT] Tightened the regex for finding java libraries and restricted
      missing-classpath tag to only be emitted for packages that actually

    + [NT] Accepted patch from Loïc Minier to support the armhf
      architecture.  (Closes: #618587)

      directories are only allowed in packages of the given architecture.
      Thanks to Steve R. Langasek for the patch.
  * checks/circular-deps{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Added to check for circular dependencies between
      binaries from the same source.  It requires all binaries
      packages to be present as well as the source package to be
      effective.  Thanks to Bill Allombert for the suggestion.
      (Closes: #316283)
  * checks/debhelper:
    + [NT] Use new alt-dh_commands data file to fetch alternative
      dependencies for dh_commands, which are sometimes provided
      indirectly by meta or API packages.
  * checks/fields:
    + [NT] Do not emit needless-dependency-on-jre for libX-gcj
      packages and only emit the tag at most once per package.
      Thanks to Rene Engelhard for the report.
      (Closes: #622396)
  * checks/files{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Added dir-or-file-in-run tag.  (Closes: #623031)

      multiarch directory without taking care of upgrades.  Thanks to
      Steve R. Langasek for the patch.

  * checks/java{,.desc}:
    + [NT] Added file based on patches submitted by Vincent Fourmond.
      This new file checks for jar files in weird locations.
      (Closes: #620829, #575447)
  * checks/manpages:
    + [NT] Fixed false-positive binary-without-manpage when the

      package is checked together with its dependency.
      (Closes: #120323)
  * checks/scripts:
    + [NT] Fixed false positive missing-dep-for-interpreter, if
      the interpreter was dash, since dash is now essential.
      (Closes: #620120)
  * checks/symlinks{,.desc}:
    + [NT] New file that checks for broken symlinks.  A symlink
      is considered broken if it does not exist in the package
      itself or in its direct dependencies.  Since only absolute
      symlinks are checked at the moment, this only partly
      fixes #217023.

  * collection/*.desc:
    + [NT] Updated the Needs-Info field to include the new
      collections where needed.
  * collection/{bin-pkg-control,fields,index}{,.desc}:

    + [NT] Removed the deprecated --unpack-level argument.  Only
      two unpack levels were available and they were equal to
      the --remove and --unpack options.
    + [NT] Stopped accepting the environment/config variables
      LINTIAN_UNPACK_LEVEL and LINTIAN_SECTION.  The former is
      redundant as explained above and the latter was deprecated
      in favor of LINTIAN_AREA.
    + [NT] Refactored the frontend to group packages together based
      on their source package.  This allows for cross-package checks.
      (Closes: #513663)

  * lib/{Lab/Package,Lintian/Processable*}.pm:
    + [NT] Added files to assist in package grouping.
  * lib/Lintian/Command/Simple.pm:

    + [NT] Accepted patch from Benjamin Drung to accept i686-linux-gnu
      as a valid triplet.  This fixes test failure in Ubuntu.
      (Closes: #622974)

  * unpack/unpack-{binpkg,changes}-l1:
    + [NT] Removed unpack scripts for binpkg and changes as these have
      been replaced by collections.

    + [NT] Added package-needs-versioned-debhelper-build-depends, which
      replaces package-lacks-versioned-build-depends-on-debhelper old
      task of warning if a missing versioned depends may lead to a build
      failure.  Currently this is only emitted for compat 8 (or higher).

lintian (2.4.3) unstable; urgency=low

  The "Policy 3.9.1" release.

  * Summary of tag changes:
    + Added:
      - embedded-library
    + Removed:
      - debian-news-entry-without-blank-line
      - dh_testversion-is-deprecated

  * checks/binaries{,.desc}:
    + [RG] Detect embedded copies of expat, libbz2, libmagic, libxml2,
      pcre3, and tiff.
    + [RG] Recognise powerpcspe and sh4 ELF objects.
    + [RA] Warn that spelling-error-in-binary may produce false positives
      for words containing non-ASCII characters.  (See #588661)
  * checks/changelog-file{,.desc}:
    + [RA] apt-listchanges has been fixed, so drop the check for NEWS
      files ending in a trailing blank line.  (Closes: #586816)
  * checks/control-files.desc:
    + [RA] Add references to Policy requirements added in 3.9.1.

  * checks/debhelper{,.desc}:

    + [RA] Allow a tilde after the compatibility level in the debhelper
      dependency.  Thanks, Axel Beckert.  (Closes: #583777)
    + [RA] Remove dh_testversion-is-deprecated.  The command is no longer
      part of debhelper, so using it now just results in a build failure,
      and there are no instances in the archive.
  * checks/description.desc:
    + [RA] Downgrade description-too-long to minor severity to match bug
      reporting standards for formatting bugs.  (Closes: #587837)

      (Closes: #579964)
  * checks/scripts{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Improve python-script-but-no-python-dep tag description to be
      clearer about the requirement for a versioned dependency for

      various Python debhelper scripts.  (Closes: #575590, #582763)
    + [RA] Add runhaskell and runghc.  (Closes: #589266)
    + [RA] Add references to Policy requirements added in 3.9.1.

      spelling error false positives.  (Closes: #588896)
  * lib/Lintian/Relation.pm:
    + [RA] Don't require a package name component after a substvar to
      follow the rules of the beginning of a package name.  Fixes
      stronger-dependency-implies-weaker false positives containing
      substvars.  (Closes: #580494)
  * lib/Lintian/Schedule.pm:
    + [ADB] Import "warning" from Lintian::Output, really fixing the
      error caused by a non-existent file referenced in a .changes
      file.  (Closes: #583555, again)

  * private/refresh-insserv-data:
    + [RG] Hardcode the '$all' virtual facility.

  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [RA] Stop attempting to report unknown tags with a fake
      description.  This was failing with an error later, and the tag was
      probably removed from Lintian and is now erroneous.

  * t/runtests:
    + [RA] Add support for skipping raw Debian package and source package
      tests.

lintian (2.4.2) unstable; urgency=low

  The "Policy 3.9.0" release.

  * Summary of tag changes:

      - bad-provided-package-name
      - conflicts-with-version
      - copyright-refers-to-deprecated-bsd-license-file
      - init.d-script-depends-on-unknown-virtual-facility
      - team-upload-has-incorrect-version-number
      - xc-package-type-in-debian-control (pedantic)
    + Removed:
      - arch-any-in-binary-pkg (now in arch-wildcard-in-binary-package)
      - package-type-in-debian-control

  * checks/changes-file.desc:
    + [RA] Add references for file-size-mismatch-in-changes-file and
      checksum-mismatch-in-changes-file.
  * checks/control-file{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Remove package-type-in-debian-control now that dpkg-dev handles
      it as desired by the d-i team.  xc-package-type-in-debian-control
      replaces it as a pedantic check to encourage switching to the
      official name.  Thanks, Raphael Hertzog.
    + [RA] Add reference for debian-control-with-duplicate-fields.
  * checks/copyright-file{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Deprecate references to /usr/share/common-licenses/BSD in
      debian/copyright following the change in Policy 3.9.0.
  * checks/fields{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Allow Breaks without a version if the broken package is a
      virtual package.
    + [RG] Check for invalid package names in provided (virtual)
      packages.
    + [RG] Exclude dash from the depends-on-essential-package checks, as
      per discussion in debian-devel.  (Closes: #587209)
    + [RA] Allow architecture wildcards in build relations and in the
      Architecture field of binary and source packages.  (Closes: #582804)

      and diagnose any architecture wildcard, not just "any".
    + [RA] Warn of using Conflicts with a version, which should normally
      be Breaks instead, but only at wild-guess certainty for now.
  * checks/huge-usr-share{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Count file size from the tar listing rather than using du.  The
      results of du vary based on file system and other factors and make
      the tag difficult to test.
  * checks/init.d{,.desc}:
    + [RG] Check for init.d scripts depending on unknown virtual
      facilities.
    + [RA] Remove checkroot from the list of scripts that should use a
      virtual dependency since $local_fs is not quite the same and some
      packages (cryptsetup) care about the difference.  (Closes: #580082)
  * checks/manpages{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Run man page checks using the en_US.UTF-8 locale now that we
      guarantee it exists.  Should hopefully fix occasional problems with

      Castro Lopo.  (Closes: #586877)

    + [RA] Recognize team uploads and do not treat them like NMUs.  Patch
      from Charles Plessy.  (Closes: #582741)
  * checks/rules.desc:
    + [RA] Add reference for debian-rules-makemaker-prefix-is-deprecated.
  * checks/scripts:
    + [RG] Correctly handle variables at the beginning of a call to
      dpkg-divert.  Thanks, Andreas Beckmann.  (Closes: #586984)

  * data/spelling/corrections:
    + [RG] Add more spelling corrections.
  * data/spelling/corrections-case:
    + [RG] Add capitalization correction for OAuth.  (Closes: #582353)
  * data/standards-version/release-dates:
    + [RA] Add Debian Policy 3.9.0.

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [RA] Set a PATH of /bin:/usr/bin if PATH is completely unset.
      Thanks, Carsten Hey.

  * lib/Lintian/Collect/Binary.pm:
    + [RG] Correctly handle ELF binaries with whitespaces in their name.
  * lib/Lintian/Relation.pm:
    + [RA] Rather than allowing only a package name or a substvar, allow
      substvars mixed into the package name.  (Closes: #580494)
  * lib/Lintian/Schedule.pm:
    + [ADB] Add missing "use Lintian::Output", required for the use of
      warning().  (Closes: #583555)

lintian (2.4.1) unstable; urgency=low

    + [RG] Use "use" instead of "require" for Text::ParseWords and move
      it outside a loop.

  * data/spelling/corrections:

    + [RG] Detect embedded copies of libpng, lib{,open}jpeg.
    + [RA] Suppress embedded-zlib if the zlib implementation is the Pascal

    + [ADB] Use Lintian::Check::check_spelling{,_picky}()
  * checks/fields:
    + [RA] Add an exception for diffutils for depending on an essential
      package without a version, since diff was renamed to diffutils and
      depending on diffutils effectively is a versioned dependency.
      Thanks, Santiago Vila.  (Closes: #575073)

    + [RG] Add some more spelling errors.
    + [RG] Uppercase every character of the correction if every
      character of the original word is too.
    + [RA] Superceded is an acceptable alternative spelling of superseded.

  * man/lintian.1:
    + [RG] Document deprecation of unpack levels.
    + [ADB] Add the new "unpacked" collection script to the list of such
      scripts.

  * checks/*:
    + [RA] Use Lintian::Tags instead of Tags.
  * checks/binaries{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Allow any RPATH containing $ORIGIN or ${ORIGIN}, not just the
      literal value $ORIGIN.  (Closes: #557511)
    + [ADB] Exempt all binary packages built from the zlib source from
      the embedded-zlib test, not just those with binary package names
      matching zlib.+.  Thanks, Mark Brown.
    + [RA] Spelling errors are no longer normalized to lowercase.
  * checks/changelog-file:
    + [RA] Suppress latest-debian-changelog-entry-without-new-date if the
      distribution is UNRELEASED.  Thanks, Raphaël Hertzog.
      (Closes: #560149)

      unbreakable word.  Thanks, Jari Aalto.  (Closes: #560005)
    + [RA] Downgrade spelling tags to severity: minor.
  * checks/control-file{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Check for < and > version dependencies in debian/control since
      dpkg-source helpfully rewrites and fixes them in binary packages.
      Thanks, Jakub Wilk.  (Closes: #557971)
    + [RA] Add a pedantic check for duplicates in relation fields in
      debian/control prior to the fixes applied by dpkg-dev.  Thanks,
      Nelson A. de Oliveira.  (Closes: #548819)
    + [RA] Fix a typo that skipped checks on the Build-Conflicts field.
    + [RA] Rework weak-library-dev-dependency to allow more approaches to
      bounding the shared library version.  Skip complex cases with or'd
      dependencies and assume the maintainer knows what they're doing.
      Add more explanation to the long tag description.  Thanks, Reinhard
      Tartler and Mike Hommey.  (Closes: #557449)
  * checks/copyright-file.desc:
    + [RA] Downgrade spelling-error-in-copyright to minor and mention
      false positive possibilities and an override in the tag description.
  * checks/cruft:
    + [RA] Allow an automake or libtool dependency in Build-Depends-Indep
      to also satisfy the check for outdated helper files.  Thanks,
      Guillaume Delacour.  (Closes: #557530)
    + [RA] Ignore files in .pc, created by unpacking 3.0 (quilt) packages.
      Thanks, Ahmed El-Mahmoudy.  (Closes: #556022)
  * checks/debian-readme.desc:
    + [RA] Downgrade spelling tag to severity: minor.
  * checks/description{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Downgrade spelling tag to severity: minor.
    + [RA] Split capitalization-error-in-description to a separate tag and
      downgrade its certainty to wild-guess.
  * checks/fields{,.desc}:
    + [ADB] Re-order the fields of build-depends-on-build-essential so that
      all of the descriptive text is included.  Thanks, Jonathan Wiltshire.
      (Closes: #557786)
    + [RA] For lib-recommends-documentation, exclude packages ending in
      -tools or -bin.  Thanks, Jay Berkenbilt.  (Closes: #557883)
    + [RA] Warn of build dependencies on python*-dev if no architecture-
      dependent packages are being built.  Patch from Luca Falavigna.
      (Closes: #551793)
    + [RA] Add emacs22 to obsolete emacs versions.  Thanks, Sven Joachim.
      (Closes: #560053)
  * checks/files{,.desc}:
    + [RA] New check for files present in both compressed and uncompressed
      form.  Patch from Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #546174)
    + [RA] Allow /etc/sudoers.d files to be mode 0440 as recommended by
      sudo.  Thanks, Thijs Kinkhorst.  (Closes: #557353)
  * checks/huge-usr-share{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Increase the thresholds to 2MB (over 50%) and 4MB (any
      percentage), and mention the thresholds in the tag description.
      Thanks, Christoph Egger.  (Closes: #561720)
  * checks/init.d{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Add checks for missing dependencies on $local_fs or $remote_fs
      based on what files appear to be used in the init scripts.  Patch
      from Raphael Geissert.  (Partly addresses #405454)
  * checks/manpages{,.desc}:
    + [RG] Check for spelling errors in English manpages.
  * checks/manpages.desc:
    + [RA] Clarify the long description of hyphen-used-as-minus-sign.
      Note that Debian groff is currently patched to avoid this problem,
      but hopefully that divergence can be removed.  Reference
      groff-base's README.Debian for more information.  (Closes: #548844)
  * checks/menus.desc:
    + [RA] Change spelling tags to severity: minor and certainty: certain
      since there are few false positives but minor is the correct
      severity.
  * checks/ocaml{,.desc}:
    + [RA] New checks for OCaml packaging.  Contributed by Stéphane
      Glondu.  (Closes: #528367)
  * checks/patch-systems{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Recommend DEP-3 in {dpatch,quilt}-patch-missing-description and
      reference the document.  Thanks, Raphaël Hertzog.  (Closes: #554025)
    + [RA] Allow DEP-3 headers in dpatch patches to satisfy the
      description requirement.  Thanks, Paul Gevers.  (Closes: #548640)
  * checks/rules{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Remove build-depends-without-arch-dep.  If the package only
      builds architecture-independent packages, the distinction between
      Build-Depends and Build-Depends-Indep is meaningless and there's no
      reason, even pedantically, to worry about the separation.  Thanks,
      Charles Plessy.  (Closes: #552200, #555667)
    + [RA] Add a new check for DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_DEBIAN_CONTROL = yes.
      Thanks, Nelson A. de Oliveira.  (Closes: #557120)

  * collection/ar-info{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Collects the results of ar t on all *.a files, used by the new
      OCaml checks.  Contributed by Stéphane Glondu.
  * collection/override-file:
    + [RA] Check debian/source/lintian-overrides before
      debian/source.lintian-overrides for source package overrides.
      Thanks, martin f krafft.  (Closes: #554617)

  * data/debhelper/*:
    + [ADB] Refresh against unstable.
  * data/fields/{perl-provides,virtual-packages}:
    + [ADB] Refresh against unstable.
  * data/files/fonts:
    + [ADB] Refresh against unstable.
  * data/output/ftp-master-{non,}fatal:
    + [RA] New data files listing tags that may result in an automated
      upload reject.

  * doc/lintian.sgml:
    + [RA] Document debian/source/lintian-overrides as the new preferred
      location for source overrides.

  * debian/control:
    + [RG] Add Raphael Geissert to Uploaders.
    + [RA] Add ${misc:Depends} to dependencies.
  * debian/copyright:
    + [RG] Add Raphael Geissert to maintainers.

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [RA] Add options --suppress-tags and --suppress-tags-from-file to
      completely suppress the given tags.
    + [RA] Support comments and blank lines in --tags-from-file files.
    + [RA] Run the check modules in sorted order.
    + [RA] Create a global Lintian::Tags object and use it instead of
      setting variables in the Tags namespace.  Move display level code
      from here to Lintian::Tags.  Adjust calls for the new Lintian::Tags
      module.
    + [RA] Add option -F or --ftp-master-rejects which only checks tags
      that could result in an automatic upload reject.
  * frontend/lintian-info:
    + [RA] Add -h/--help option.  Patch from gregor herrmann.
      (Closes: #558214)

  * lib/Lintian/Check.pm:
    + [RA] Use Lintian::Tags instead of Tags.
  * lib/Lintian/Output.pm:
    + [RA] print_tag() now takes an additional argument containing
      override data and expects a Lintian::Tag::Info object as the tag
      info instead of a hash.
    + [RA] Adjust for the renaming of pkg in the file information hash.
  * lib/Lintian/Output/*.pm:
    + [RA] Adjust for print_tag() and file information hash changes.
  * lib/Lintian/Output/XML.pm:
    + [RA] Rewrite to be more readable and fix the tags attribute for
      overridden experimental tags.
  * lib/Lintian/Relation.pm:
    + [RA] Fix bugs in unparse() and duplicates() that caused duplicates()
      to crash when processing duplicates between an alternative and a
      regular package.  Thanks, Jonathan Yu.  (Closes: #559625)
  * lib/Lintian/Tag/Info.pm:
    + [RA] Add a code method that returns the tag code corresponding to
      the severity and certainty for a tag, based on get_tag_code from
      Tags.pm.
    + [RA] Add certainty, severity, and tag accessor methods.
    + [RA] Add a method saying whether a tag is experimental.
    + [RA] Record the check script corresponding to each tag and add an
      accessor method for it.
    + [RA] Add a sources method returning a list of sources referenced by
      a tag, based on the get_tag_source method from Tags.pm.
  * lib/Lintian/Tags.pm:
    + [RA] New module in a proper namespace replacing Tags.pm.  A global
      Lintian::Tags object replaces the static variables in the Tags
      namespace, with new accessor functions, except for the tag metadata
      functions (which have moved to Lintian::Tag::Info).  All handling of
      display levels is now here instead of in frontend/lintian.
    + [RA] Support suppressing a list of tags.
    + [RA] Suppress calling Lintian::Output::print_end_pkg for changes
      files, where we don't call print_start_pkg.  This fixes an unmatched
      closing tag in the experimental XML output.
  * lib/Spelling.pm:
    + [RA] Use Lintian::Tags instead of Tags.
    + [RA] Ignore all-caps words of five characters or less for spelling
      corrections, since they are probably acronyms.  Thanks, Michal
      Čihař.  (Closes: #556456)
    + [RA] Report the original word in spelling errors rather than the
      normalized form.
    + [RG] Detect some multi-word spelling errors.
    + [RA] Remove the als to also correction.  This is a word in several
      European languages, and the many hits on the archive are nearly all
      false positives.
  * lib/Tags.pm:
    + [RA] Removed in favor of Lintian::Tags.
  * lib/Util.pm:
    + [RA] Consume all output from extracting the control file of a binary
      package before closing the pipe.

  * man/lintian.1:
    + [RA] Document --suppress-tags and --suppress-tags-from-file.
    + [RA] Document format of --tags-from-file.
    + [RA] Document -F (--ftp-master-rejects).
    + [RA] Add ocaml checker script.
    + [RA] Add ar-info collection script.
    + [RA] Document the override locations in the FILES section.  Thanks,
      Jakub Wilk.  (Closes: #558649)
    + [RA] Remove obsolete spelling checker script.
    + [RA] Mention /usr/share/lintian/data under FILES.
    + [RA] Clarify that errors are not necessarily policy violations.
    + [RA] Remove bug that Lintian doesn't handle packages with different
      binary and source versions correctly.  I don't believe this is still
      an issue.
  * man/lintian-info.1:
    + [RA] Add -h (--help).
    + [RA] lintian -i no longer pipes output through lintian-info.  Adjust
      the man page accordingly.

  * private/refresh-ftp-master-tags:
    + [RA] Script to refresh data about automatic package rejects.

  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [RA] Never use O as the code for the tag on the per-tag page even if
      all instances in the archive are overridden.  (Closes: #562630)

  * t/runtests:
    + [RA] Unwrap the Options field so that it can be continued.
    + [RA] Replace TESTSET in Options with the root of the test suite so
      that lintian options referring to files can be tested with files in
      the test suite directory.
    + [RA] Support a new Sort: no field in package test metadata to
      suppress sorting of lintian output, for testing output formatting.
    + [RA] Use Lintian::Command::spawn to run Lintian for package tests so
      that the lintian options may contain shell metacharacters.
    + [RA] Put all error output from lintian unsorted before the regular
      output, making it easier to diagnose errors.
    + [RA] Suppress checking the syntax of the lintian output if neither
      Test-For nor Test-Against are set and Sort: no is set.

  * unpack/list-{bin,src,udeb}pkg:
    + [RA] Support multiple versions of a package in the archive and
      include only the latest version in the Lintian package list.
  * unpack/unpack-binpkg-l2:
    + [RA] Report errors from dpkg-deb or tar on stderr if either exit
      with non-zero status.
  * unpack/unpack-srcpkg-l2:
    + [RA] Report errors from dpkg-source -x on stderr if it exits with
      non-zero status.  (Closes: #557717)

lintian (2.2.18) unstable; urgency=low

  The "synchronize severities with ftpmaster's Lintian checks" release.

  * Summary of tag changes:
    + Removed:
      - copyright-lists-upstream-authors-with-dh_make-boilerplate
    + Promoted from experimental:
      - spelling-error-in-binary
      - template-uses-unsplit-choices

  * checks/binaries.desc:
    + [RA] Remove experimental marker on spelling-error-in-binary.  Change
      severity to minor; spelling errors are minor bugs.
    + [RA] library-in-debug-or-profile-should-not-be-stripped,
      binary-or-shlib-defines-rpath, arch-dependent-file-in-usr-share, and
      binary-in-etc, binary-file-compressed-with-upx,
      binary-with-bad-dynamic-table, and embedded-zlib are now
      serious since they can result in ftpmaster rejects.  embedded-zlib,
      missing-dependency-on-libc, and binary-or-shlib-defines-rpath are
      possible rather than certain since overrides are allowed.
  * checks/changelog-file:
    + [FL] Avoid various Perl warnings which can be caused by
      completely broken changelog files.
  * checks/conffiles.desc:
    + [RA] file-in-usr-marked-as-conffile is serious (ftpmaster reject).
      Add a Policy reference and improve the description.
    + [RA] non-etc-file-marked-as-conffile is serious/possible rather than
      important/certain (ftpmaster reject unless overridden).
  * checks/control-file{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Say to use (= ${binary:Version}) to fix weak dependencies
      between a library dev package and the shared library.  Thanks,
      Norbert Preining.  (Closes: #548218)
    + [ADB] Fix an uninitialised value warning when processing a
      -dev package which has no Depends: fields.  Thanks, Lucas
      Nussbaum.
    + [RA] build-info-in-binary-control-file-section and
      debian-control-with-duplicate-fields are now serious (ftpmaster
      reject).
    + [RA] Allow -dev dependencies based on source:Upstream-Version or
      source:Version if the -dev package is architecture: all.  Thanks,
      Mike Hommey.  (Closes: #552729)
  * checks/control-files.desc:
    + [RA] not-allowed-control-file, control-file-has-bad-permissions, and
      control-file-has-bad-owner are now serious (ftpmaster reject).
      Mention that the config control file should also be executable.
  * checks/copyright-file{,.desc}:
    + [FL] Add special exception to no-copyright-file for perl.
      See #522827 for discussion.  (Closes: #553262)
    + [FL] Extend match for exceptions to copyright-refers-to-symlink-license
      to catch more ways to specify Perl's license.  Patch from
      Salvatore Bonaccorso.  (Closes: #549596)
    + [RA] copyright-lists-upstream-authors-with-dh_make-boilerplate
      removed, as some package maintainers prefer to use Author(s) and
      have filled out the copyright file.  (Closes: #553469)
    + [RA] Add additional dh_make template strings to the
      helper-templates-in-copyright check, including the templates for
      upstream author or copyright holder, which effectively replaces
      copyright-lists-upstream-authors-with-dh_make-boilerplate with far
      fewer false positives.
    + [RA] Remove a duplication of the check for "This copyright info was
      automatically extracted from the perl module" by dh-make-perl, and
      ensure that this is copyright-contains-dh-make-perl-boilerplate and
      not helper-templates-in-copyright, since it is lower severity.
    + [RA] copyright-refers-to-old-directory, old-style-copyright-file,
      usr-share-doc-symlink-without-dependency,
      usr-share-doc-symlink-to-foreign-package,
      copyright-refers-to-incorrect-directory, and
      copyright-contains-dh_make-todo-boilerplate are now serious
      (ftpmaster reject).  copyright-contains-dh_make-todo-boilerplate is
      possible (overrides allowed).  Significantly improve the description
      of usr-share-doc-symlink-without-dependency to mention that Lintian
      doesn't look at transitive dependencies, and change to possible.
  * checks/cruft:
    + [FL] Add automake1.11 to list of autotools packages.  Thanks,
      Laurent Bigonville.  (Closes: #551051)
    + [RA] Allow CMakeCache.txt files in the debian directory.  Thanks,
      Aaron M. Ucko.  (Closes: #553264)
  * checks/debconf.desc:
    + [FL] Remove experimental flag from template-uses-unsplit-choices.
      This was only done to not disrupt the lenny freeze.  Thanks,
      Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #553487)
  * checks/description.desc:
    + [RA] Downgrade description-synopsis-might-not-be-phrased-properly to
      minor and fix the cross-reference to point to devref, not Policy.
    + [RA] description-is-dh_make-template is serious (ftpmaster reject).
  * checks/etcfiles.desc:
    + [RA] file-in-etc-not-marked-as-conffile is serious (ftpmaster
      reject).
  * checks/fields{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Fix lib-recommends-documentation tag to correctly exclude dev
      and doc packages.  Patch from Stéphane Glondu.  (Closes: #548210)
    + [FL] Allow source formats 3.0 (quilt) and 3.0 (native).
      (Closes: #552707)
    + [RA] Multiple maintainer-* and uploader-* tags for syntax errors or
      localhost addresses are now serious (ftpmaster reject), as are
      section-is-dh_make-template and bad-relation.
  * checks/files.desc:
    + [RA] Add a note to wrong-file-owner-uid-or-gid that it's possible to
      construct a Policy-compliant package that triggers this tag by
      creating users in preinst, and asking package maintainers to file a
      bug against Lintian if they encounter a case where this appears to
      be necessary.
    + [RA] package-contains-ancient-file, package-installs-python-pyc
      symlink-has-too-many-up-segments, and package-contains-info-dir-file
      are now serious (ftpmaster reject).
    + [RA] dir-or-file-in-var-www is now serious/possible (ftpmaster
      reject unless overridden).
    + [RA] dir-or-file-in-{tmp,mnt,opt,srv} are now serious and have the
      proper File Hierarchy Standard cross-references and descriptions.
    + [RA] Don't suggest creating a symlink to the python-feedparser
      library.  Just use the normal Python import mechanism.  Thanks,
      Jakub Wilk.  (Closes: #555617)
  * checks/lintian.desc:
    + [CW] Add lucid as an allowable distribution for Ubuntu, and remove
      gutsy.
  * checks/manpages.desc:
    + [ADB] Mention in the description for manpage-has-errors-from-man
      that Lintian passes "-E UTF-8" to man when running checks.  Thanks,
      Raphaël Hertzog. (Closes: #555320)
    + [RA] Also suppress failures to break lines if the reported line is
      a .UE macro, which marks the end of a block defining a URL.  Thanks,
      Martin Stigge.
  * checks/patch-systems:
    + [RA] Do not issue patch-system-but-no-source-readme for packages in
      3.0 (quilt) format.  Patch from Stéphane Glondu.  (Closes: #553207)
    + [RA] Don't consider the "index <sha1>..<sha1>" line added by git
      diff to be a patch description.  (Closes: #553697)
    + [RA] If a diff outside of the patch system only creates new files
      that can be copied into place by the package build rules, suggest
      just putting them in the debian directory rather than using a patch
      system.  Thanks, Charles Plessy.  (Closes: #550924)
  * checks/rules.desc:
    + [RA] missing-build-dependency is now serious/possible (ftpmaster
      reject unless overridden).
  * checks/scripts{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Add some more details to executable-not-elf-or-script about
      possible causes and how to correct them.
    + [RA] Suggest mkfifo in mknod-in-maintainer-script if the script was
      creating a named pipe.
    + [RA] Add rep.  Thanks, Rodrigo Gallardo.  (Closes: #510954)
    + [RA] Add r.  Thanks, Dirk Eddelbuettel.  (Closes: #555278)
    + [RA] Add rackup.  Thanks, Sebastien Delafond.  (Closes: #552013)
  * checks/shared-libs:
    + [FL] Add /usr/lib/python*/dist-packages to exception list for
      incorrect-libdir-in-la-file.  Thanks, Mathieu Trudel.
      (Closes: #551134)

  * data/changelog-file/ubuntu-dists:
    + [CW] Add lucid as an allowable distribution for Ubuntu, and remove
      gutsy.
  * data/doc-base/sections:
    + [FL] Update from doc-base 0.9.5. Adds Typesetting section.
      Thanks Julian Gilbey.  (Closes: #552526)
  * data/fields/architectures:
    + [ADB] Refresh against unstable.
  * data/fields/perl-provides:
    + [ADB] Refresh against unstable.
  * data/fields/virtual-packages:
    + [ADB] Refresh against unstable.
  * data/files/fonts:
    + [ADB] Refresh against unstable.

  * man/lintian.1:
    + [RA] Add additional explanation of experimental tags.  Remove the
      comment that pedantic tags are frequently wrong; that's not what
      they're for.  Improve the explanation for -i to not imply that
      everything Lintian finds is a Policy violation.

  * private/refresh-perl-provides:

      (Closes: #547773)

  * debian/control:
    + [RA] Explicitly depend on libclass-accessor-perl, since we use it
      directly.  (libparse-debianchangelog-perl was implicitly ensuring it
      was installed.)

      (Closes: #547631)
  * lib/Spelling.pm:
    + [RA] Additional spelling corrections from Raphael Geissert.

      Stéphane Glondu.  (Closes: #498138)
    + [RA] Allow ldconfig to be statically linked.
  * checks/changelog-file:
    + [RA] Don't warn about a symlinked changelog file if the version
      contains ubuntu.  Thanks, Benjamin Drung.  (Closes: #536434)
  * checks/common_data.pm:
    + [RA] Moved the essential package list to data/fields.
  * checks/copyright-file:
    + [RA] Use Lintian::Data to read the essential package list.
  * checks/debhelper:
    + [RA] Ignore whitespace when checking debian/compat, since Perl will
      when converting it to a number.  Thanks, Niels Thykier.
      (Closes: #545430)
  * checks/fields{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Exclude base-files from the needlessly-depends-on-awk tag
      and from the warning about depending on a virtual package without
      a real package for the awk virtual package.
    + [RA] Use Lintian::Data to read the essential package list.
    + [RA] Stop allowing unversioned build dependencies on coreutils.  The
      migration from fileutils is long since finished.
    + [RA] Check for build dependencies on packages that should not be
      used for builds.  (Closes: #540594)
    + [RA] Allow architecture-dependent metapackages, since it can be
      useful for metapackages to change dependencies based on the
      architecture.  Thanks, Vagrant Cascadian.  (Closes: #544004)
  * checks/files{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Suppress non-standard-dir-perm for /tmp, /var/tmp, /var/local,
      /var/lock, and /usr/src if they have their normal owner and
      permissions.  This suppresses some Lintian tags for base-files.
    + [RA] Allow base-files to ship /var/backups and /var/local.
    + [RA] Remove swfobject.js from the known packaged Javascript
      libraries.  The version in libjs-yui is old and the new version is
      not packaged.  Thanks, Giuseppe Iuculano.  (Closes: #542046)
    + [RA] Allow t1- and xfonts- as prefixes for font packages since the
      font regex is also looking for Type 1 fonts.  Thanks, Rogério
      Brito.  (Closes: #542389)
    + [RA] Stop looking for *.pcf files outside font packages.  The check
      wasn't triggering since PCF files are always compressed, and the
      situation for PCF font packages is more complex and not suitable for
      the same check.
    + [RA] Add mootools.js to embedded-javascript-library.  Patch from
      Marcelo Jorge Vieira (metal).  (Closes: #545716)
    + [RA] Check for putting data that should be in /usr/share under
      /usr/share/games.  Patch from Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #534486)
  * checks/init.d{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Add new checks for starting in runlevels 0 and 6, providing a
      virtual facility, not providing a facility matching the script, not
      depending on a virtual facility, and inconsistent stop runlevels.
      Patch from Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #544221)
  * checks/manpages{,.desc}:
    + [ADB] Add HTTPS to the list of recognised protocols for URLs in manpages
      which should not cause manpage-has-errors-from-man to be emitted.
      (Closes: #543641)
    + [RA] Document the MANWIDTH variable when running man by hand to
      check for man page errors.  (Closes: #542584)
    + [RA] Adjust the exclusion of pod2man's .IX macro for the new
      output format from groff.
  * checks/menu-format{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Add a pointer to desktop-file-validate in many of the tag
      descriptions for desktop tags.  (Closes: #539403)
    + [RA] Mention in the description of desktop-entry-invalid-category
      that whitespace isn't allowed and categories are case-sensitive.
    + [RA] Add a new check for desktop entries that are limited to
      multiple environments.  NotShowIn was probably intended instead.
      Thanks, Andrew Lee.  (Closes: #537737)
  * checks/rules:
    + [RA] Anchor the dh_quilt regex to not trigger on commented-out
      calls.  Patch from Cesare Tirabassi.  (Closes: #543259)
    + [RA] When checking for out-of-order debhelper calls, take into
      account the -p flag and only check within each package.  Thanks,
      Michael Koch.  (Closes: #545219)
  * checks/scripts{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Don't warn about missing dependencies on programs if the
      program invocation is followed by || true.  Thanks, Aurelien Jarno.
      (Closes: #541372)
    + [RA] Permit diversion of a man page as long as the package is
      installing a man page by the same name in the same numeric section,
      even if the specific section is different.  Thanks, Niko Tyni.
      (Closes: #543781)
    + [RA] Check example scripts for most of the same issues as scripts
      elsewhere in the package, but report problems with a different set
      of tags with info or pedantic severity.  Patch from Damyan Ivanov.
      (Closes: #543873)
    + [RA] Add seed.  Thanks, Josselin Mouette.  (Closes: #543779)
    + [RA] Add pike 7.8.  Thanks, Magnus Holmgren.  (Closes: #543262)
  * checks/shared-libs:

      dependencies, currently containing only java-propose-classpath.
      Thanks, Josh Triplett.
  * data/files/fonts:
    + [RA] Refresh and include Type 1 fonts and packages as well.

  * lib/Lintian/Collect/Binary.pm:
    + [RA] Stop looking for the special OCaml symbol.  OCaml custom
      binaries are now detected another way.  Patch from Stéphane Glondu.
  * lib/Lintian/Schedule.pm:
    + [RA] If declining to add a duplicate file to the Lintian check
      schedule, return success to avoid a spurious error message.  Patch
      from Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #542072)
  * lib/Spelling.pm:
    + [RA] Add spelling correction for "aplication."  (Closes: #546404)

  * private/refresh-fonts-data:
    + [RA] To match what checks/files looks for, also look for *.pfb files
      and packages starting with t1-.

  * reporting/{html_reports,templates/clean.tmpl}:
    + [JP] Don't link to full report if the maintainer only has clean
      packages. (Closes: #545781)

    + [RA] Recognize packages as metapackages even if they contain Lintian
      overrides, thus fixing two packages that added a Lintian override
      for having dependencies only permitted for metapackages, which in
      turn ensures that they keep getting that tag.
    + [RA] Recognize packages as metapackages even if they contain files
      in /usr/share/cdd.
    + [RA] Renamed the tags for depending or build-depending on X
      metapackages to make them generic and load the list of metapackages
      from data/fields/metapackages.  Always consider known metapackages
      to be metapackages for the dependency check.

      fragments in debian/rules must Build-Depend on mozilla-devscripts.
      Thanks, Benjamin Drung.  (Closes: #541144)

    + [RA] Save source listing errors in index-errors for later processing
      by cruft.  Don't fail the unpack if tar exits with non-zero status.
      star-created archives will cause tar to blow up, but the listing
      and unpacking still works.
  * unpack/unpack-srcpkg-l2:
    + [RA] Save source unpack errors in unpacked-errors for later
      processing by cruft.

       - doc-package-should-be-section-doc
       - perl-package-should-be-section-perl
       - python-package-should-be-section-python

  * checks/deb-format.desc:
    + [RA] In the tag description, the first required element should be
      debian-binary, not debian-control.  Thanks, Judit Foglszinger.
      (Closes: #521012)
  * checks/fields{,.desc}:
    + [FL] Update list of valid sections.  (Closes: #521782)
    + [RA] Fix dbg-package-missing-depends check when the dependency is
      followed by a comma.  (Closes: #520640)
    + [FL] Add package name checks for the new sections.  Move all package
      section checks to one tag "wrong-section-according-to-package-name"
      instead of one tag per section.
    + [FL] Add checks for well formatted Vcs-* fields.  (Closes: #517635)
  * checks/lintian.desc:
    + [CW] Add karmic as an allowable distribution for Ubuntu (thanks, Soren
      Hansen).
  * checks/scripts:
    + [RA] Fix a hash collision that could suppress a correct
      remove-of-unknown-diversion tag if the diversion was removed in
      multiple maintainer scripts including postrm.
    + [RA] Handle variables in maintainer scripts when adding and removing
      diversions.  Patch from Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #519268)
  * checks/shared-libs:
    + [RA] Correctly handle SONAMEs in symbols files that contain regex
      metacharacters like +.  Thanks, Daniel Kobras.  (Closes: #521621)

  * collection/file-info:
    + [RA] Use chomp instead of chop to remove newlines.
    + [RA] Ignore error returns from file.  file returns non-zero if it
      can't parse some files, but the resulting output is still fine for
      Lintian's purposes.  Thanks to Raphael Geissert for the problem
      identification.  (Closes: #521257)

  * data/changelog-file/ubuntu-dists:
    + [CW] Add karmic as an allowable distribution for Ubuntu (thanks, Soren
      Hansen).

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [RA] Belatedly bump the lab format version for many recent changes.

  * lib/Lintian/Command.pm:
    + [RA] In kill, initialize the result status and use &&= instead of |=.

  * unpack/unpack-srcpkg-l1:
    + [RA] Better anchor the regexes that parse the file list in a source
      package.

  The "Policy 3.8.1" release.

  * Summary of tag changes:
    + Added
      - dir-or-file-in-var-lock
      - dir-or-file-in-var-run

  * checks/changelog-file.desc:
    + [RA] Using UTF-8 is now a Policy must and hence serious.
  * checks/control-file.desc:
    + [RA] Using UTF-8 is now a Policy must and hence serious.
  * checks/files{,.desc}:
    + [CW] Emit dir-or-file-in-var-lock or dir-or-file-in-var-run, as
      appropriate, for packages shipping directories or files in /var/lock
      or /var/run. See policy bug #514326.
  * checks/menus{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Revert the change to not require update-menus in postinst.
      This is still needed due to #518919.  Don't require update-menus in
      postrm for regular menu files, only for menu-methods, but also don't
      warn if it's present.  (Closes: #519300)
  * checks/scripts:
    + [RA] Policy allows scripts to assume that /bin/sh supports local
      with simple variable assignments.
    + [ADB] Check all added and removed diversions at once rather than
      as each maintainer script is processed.  This avoids differing
      results and false positives if the postrm is processed before other
      maintainer scripts.  (Closes: #518966)

    + [RA] Remove symlinks as a (possibly temporary) workaround to
      packages that contain broken links to dh_* commands.
    + [RA] Exclude dh_gencontrol from debhelper commands that set
      ${misc:Depends} since it only sets it to empty when not already
      set.
  * private/refresh-fonts-data:
    + [RA] Correctly handle not specifying a Contents file on the command
      line.

  * t/runtests:
    + [RA] Add support for running test scripts under t/scripts via prove
      (the standard Perl test harness).

      that explains the problem.  Based on a patch from Raphael Geissert.
      (Closes: #517191)
    + [RA] Allow commas between the GFDL license name and version when
      suppressing false positives for the 1.1 version.  Thanks, Aurelien

      longer required unless menu-methods are installed.  Thanks, Eric
      Lavarde.  (Closes: #518712)

      occurs between the end of the dependency template(s) and the start of
      the symbol list.  The code that was intended to check this resulted
      in a false positive syntax error being generated if a file with

    + [ADB] Extend the parsing of dependency templates in symbols files to
      handle ORed dependencies.

      that has successfully including its current version number.  Use
      these marker files rather than the existence of output files to
      determine when to run collect scripts.  Re-run collect scripts if

      whitespace of subsequent lines left in, and leading tabs are no
      longer handled specially.  Trailing whitespace is now uniformly
      stripped, as is leading whitespace on the first field line.

  * checks/cruft:
    + [RA] For Format: 2.0 and Format: 3.0 (quilt) packages, check

      file we scan.  Patch from Raphael Geissert.
    + [ADB] Modify the check for embedded Javascript libraries to ignore
      yahoo.js as there are similarly named, but unrelated, scripts in
      the archive.
    + [ADB] Lower the certainty of the embedded-{javascript,php}-library
      tags to "possible" as they trigger purely on filenames and not
      content.  (Closes: #515690)
    + [RA] Offer advice for duplicate-font-file for when the font package
      is huge.  Thanks, Thijs Kinkhorst and Paul Wise.  (Closes: #515689)

    + [RA] Use set -e, not #!/bin/sh -e.

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [ADB] Split the Distribution field of a .changes file into individual
      distributions and then check each of them against the list of known
      distributions.  (Closes: #514853)
    + [ADB] Anchor the regular expressions for the backports, security and
      proposed-updates distribution checks, so that etch-backports is
      accepted as a valid distribution but etch-backportss is not.
    + [ADB] Add a new check for .changes files which contain multiple
      entries in their Distribution: field.  The check is currently
      disabled as the syntax is currently accepted by dak although it is
      likely to stop being so in the near future.

      Raphael Geissert.
    + [RA] Only take the first space after a field name as the separator
      and treat the rest as part of the field value so that other parts of
      Lintian can see the leading spaces.

  * private/refresh-virtual-packages-data:
    + [RA] New script to generate the list of virtual packages.  Based on
      a patch by Raphael Geissert.
  * private/update-coverage:

      sections.

      Patch from Evgeni Golov.  (Closes: #513946)
  * checks/cruft{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Downgrade all source-contains-* tags to pedantic.  These are
      upstream problems the packager can't do much about and they have
      no practical effect on the Debian package.  Wishlist implies that
      a wishlist bug against the package would be appropriate, which
      seems too strong.
    + [RA] Add pedantic check for binaries in the upstream source.  Patch
      from Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #127494)
  * checks/description{,.desc}:

    + [RA] Add check (wishlist/wild-guess) for apparent home page URLs in
      the long description with no Homepage field.  Based on a patch by
      Paul Wise.  (Closes: #339829)
  * checks/fields{,.desc}:
    + [ADB] Remove checks for the capitalisation of the obsolete non-US
      archive section.

      containing a version number.  Based on a patch by Paul Wise.
    + [RA] Warn of dfsg versions in native packages.
    + [RA] Warn of ".dfsg" versions and recommend "+dfsg" for version
      sorting reasons.  Thanks, Paul Wise.  (Closes: #514203)

    + [RA] Use Lintian::Relation and the new Lintian::Collect support for

    + [RA] Also run file-info for source packages.  Patch from Raphael

      circular dependencies at compilation time.

    + [RA] New method relation() to return a Lintian::Relation object for
      a given relationship field or set of relationship fields.
  * lib/Lintian/Collect/Source.pm:
    + [RA] New methods relation() and relation_noarch() to return
      Lintian::Relation objects for a given build relationship field or
      set of fields.  New method binary_relation() to return a
      Lintian::Relation object for a given relationship field in a binary
      package built from this source package.
    + [RA] Add file_info() method to return file information for source
      packages.  Patch from Raphael Geissert.
  * lib/Lintian/Relation.pm:
    + [RA] New class based on the existing Dep module that handles package
      relationship analysis.  Now includes documentation, uses a more
      object-oriented structure, and removes a special case handling of
      Perl alternatives.  This module will eventually replace Dep.
  * lib/Lintian/Relation/Version.pm:
    + [RA] New module containing the version comparison code from Dep.
      This module will only be needed until Lintian is converted to
      Dpkg::Version or AptPkg::Version.
  * lib/Spelling.pm:
    + [RA] Add some additional typo and case corrections.  Patch from
      Raphael Geissert.

  * t/runtests:
    + [RA] Copy test suite data based on checksum, not size and time,
      since some files change one character and Git doesn't preserve
      timestamps.  Patch from Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #514496)

  * unpack/list-{binpkg,udebpkg}:
    + [RA] Preserve the source_version field from the previous list when
      adding new packages, remove some dead code, and restructure for
      improved readability.  Thanks to Jordà Polo for the analysis.

lintian (2.2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  The "this is why spooky action at a distance is bad" release.

  * checks/copyright-file:
    + [ADB] Treat the new copyright file format's "License-Alias: Perl" as
      indicating that the package is licensed under the same terms as Perl.
      Thanks, gregor herrmann.  (Closes: #513831)
  * checks/debconf:
    + [RA] Reset $/ before issuing duplicate-fields-in-templates to
      prevent problems if -i was given.
  * checks/debhelper:
    + [RA] Remove stray localization of $/, which broke -i when issuing
      tags about ${misc:Depends}.
  * checks/fields:
    + [RA] Stop pointlessly setting $/ while parsing debian/rules and then
      restoring it to the wrong value, which broke -i when issuing some
      tags if they were the first tags issued.
  * checks/scripts:
    + [RA] Add nickle as a known interpreter.  Patch from Julien Cristau.
      (Closes: #513823)

  * lib/Util.pm:
    + [ADB] Localise a use of $_ in control file parsing to avoid overwriting

      versions.   Patch from Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #497346)
  * checks/debhelper{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Use binary_field() to read control fields for binary packages.
      Patch from Raphael Geissert.
    + [RA] Read only the first line of debian/compat, matching debhelper's
      behavior.  Improve the parsing of DH_COMPAT to pick up values that

      the Build script is referenced in clean.  Thanks, Charles Plessy and
      gregor herrmann.  (Closes: #421549)
  * checks/fields{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Run dbg-package-missing-depends against the source package
      instead of the binary package and check that it has a dependency
      against another binary package built from the same source rather
      than making assumptions about the package name.  Patch from Raphael
      Geissert.  (Closes: #513336)
    + [RA] Use binary_field() to read control fields for binary packages.
      Patch from Raphael Geissert.
  * checks/files{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Add check for fonts in non-font packages.  Thanks, Paul Wise
      and Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #513650)
    + [RA] Add check for fonts that duplicate already packaged fonts.
      Patch from Raphael Geissert.  Thanks to Paul Wise for analysis and

    + [RA] Use binary_field() to read control fields for binary packages.
      Patch from Raphael Geissert.

  * data/files/fonts:
    + [RA] New file listing all font filenames in Debian and the

  * lib/Lintian/Collect/Source.pm:
    + [RA] Add binary_field() method to return a binary package field from
      debian/control for a source package.  Based on a patch by Raphael
      Geissert.
    + [RA] Rewrite the binaries() method to use binary_field().  Based on
      a patch by Raphael Geissert.
  * lib/Lintian/Output.pm:
    + [ADB] Add a colour for pedantic tags to avoid warnings when colourised
      output is used and make the combination more useful.  Thanks, gregor
      herrmann.  (Closes: #513132)
    + [RA] Use Lintian::Tag::Info instead of Read_taginfo.
    + [RA] Force early exporting of functions to be more robust in the

    + [RA] Use Lintian::Tag::Info instead of Read_taginfo.
  * lib/Lintian/Tag/Info.pm:
    + [RA] New module providing an interface to tag metadata.  Currently,
      this only supports formatting the tag description, merging the
      actions previously done by Manual_refs.pm and Read_taginfo.pm.  It
      defers loading of manual references until they're needed, which
      removes the requirement that LINTIAN_ROOT be already set in the
      environment before running the reporting harness.  It also saves a
      small amount of time in runs without -I.
  * lib/Manual_refs.pm:
    + [RA] Removed, merged into Lintian::Tag::Info.

  * man/lintian.1:
    + [ADB] Fix the spelling of "pedantic".  Thanks, Michal Čihař.
      (Closes: #513083)

  * private/refresh-fonts-data:
    + [RA] New script to refresh the list of font filenames and containing
      packages in Debian.  Based on a script by Raphael Geissert.
  * private/refresh-manual-refs:
    + [RA] Renamed from manual_refs_update.pl.  Add a section heading to
      the output file and update the file in Lintian's data directory
      directly rather than printing to standard output.

  * reporting/config:
    + [RA] Set a bin directory and disable signature checks by default.
  * reporting/harness
    + [RA] Add the bin directory to the path and create a gpg link to
      /bin/true if signature checks are disabled.  This is a hack to work
      with the etch version of dpkg-source.  In lenny, the --no-check flag
      will be used instead.  Patch from Raphael Geissert.
  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [RA] Use Lintian::Tag::Info instead of Read_taginfo.

  * t/runtests:
    + [RA] Add support for selecting a different test package skeleton.
  * t/templates/pedantic{,.upstream}:
    + [RA] New template that passes all pedantic checks.

      fail during unpack, but dpkg-deb is more forgiving than dak and
      allows ordering problems and extra members that dak rejects.
      (Closes: #292055)
  * checks/fields:
    + [RA] Use check_maintainer from Lintian::Check, which suppresses
      duplicate tags for some ill-formed maintainer fields.
  * checks/lintian.desc:
    + [RA] New tag descriptions for Changed-By field tests.
  * checks/rules:
    + [RA] Consider a define command to be the end of a list of target
      commands, avoiding binary-arch-rules-but-pkg-is-arch-indep false
      positives when an empty rule is followed by a definition.
      (Closes: #510869)

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [RA] Run maintainer well-formedness checks on the Changed-By field
      of the *.changes file.  (Closes: #183642)

  * lib/Lintian/Check.pm:
    + [RA] New module for checks run from multiple places.
  * lib/Lintian/{Output.pm,Output/*.pm}:
    + [RA] Expect a single string of extra information rather than an
      array, removing duplicate code to convert it to a string.
  * lib/Lintian/Schedule.pm:
    + [RA] Fix Perl warnings triggered by missing fields in the control
      file of a binary package.
  * lib/Tags.pm:
    + [RA] Avoid Perl warnings if Severity or Certainty isn't set for a
      tag.  (Closes: #507278)
    + [RA] Record statistics for certainty correctly.
    + [RA] Canonicalize the extra tag information once and pass it as a
      string to the other output methods.  Based on a patch by Raphael
      Geissert.  (Closes: #498883)
    + [RA] Fix override checking with extra tag information that Perl
      evaluates to false (such as a bare 0).

  * man/lintian.1:
    + [RA] Document new deb-format check script.

  * t/runtests:
    + [RA] Add support for running lintian on changes files in t/changes
      and checking the tag output.
    + [RA] Add support for building a Debian package using basic tools,
      with more complete control over the contents, and running lintian on
      the results.
    + [RA] Fix exit status when a test fails but -k was given.

      - version-refers-to-distribution
    + Removed
      - desktop-file-but-no-dh_desktop-call
      - interpreter-without-predep

  * checks/changelog-file{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Warn of Debian version numbers containing "testing", "stable",
      or "unstable", or with release code names for uploads not targeted
      at that release, except in NMUs.  Based on a patch by Raphael
      Geissert.  (Closes: #498876)
  * checks/control-file{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Warn (severity: wishlist) of binary control stanzas duplicating
      fields of the source control stanza.  (Closes: #497348)
  * checks/copyright-file{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Warn (severity: wishlist) about the old dh_make packaging
      copyright, which used (C) without the word or symbol.  Based on a
      patch by Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #497347)
    + [RA] Clean up checks of a symlinked /usr/share/doc directory and
      avoid making package info global.
    + [RA] Warn about older PHP licenses.  Based on a patch by Raphael
      Geissert.  (Closes: #498875)
  * checks/cruft:
    + [RA] Keep the hash of files for which warnings were already issued
      local to each package, reducing memory consumption and false
      negatives for archive-wide runs.
  * checks/debhelper{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Check for use of shell brace expansion in debhelper config
      files that list filenames, which is not supported.  Based on a patch
      from Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #480939)
    + [RA] If dh is used, require debhelper tokens in maintainer scripts.
    + [ADB] Warn about packages declaring a debhelper compatibility level
      of 7 or above and using dh_clean -k, which has been deprecated in
      favour of dh_prep.
    + [RA] Add dh_auto_* and dh_prep to the debhelper scripts that require
      a particular version of debhelper.
    + [RA] De-duplicate the list of scripts with specific version
      requirements before issuing tags.
    + [RA] Upgrade package-lacks-versioned-build-depends-on-debhelper to
      certain (although still minor), making it a warning.  debhelper(7)
      explicitly recommends a versioned build dependency on debhelper.
      Rewrite the tag description accordingly.
  * checks/fields:
    + [RA] dh-make-php provides a CDBS rule fragment and hence should go
      into Build-Depends, not Build-Depends-Indep.  Thanks, Mathieu
      Parent.  (Closes: #509286)
  * checks/files{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Packages whose executables are all in /usr/games should
      probably be in section games.  (Closes: #509147)
  * checks/menu-format{,.desc}:
    + [RA] If a *.desktop file contains a MimeType key, check that the
      postinst calls update-desktop-database.  (Closes: #488832)
    + [RA] Stop keeping a separate hash of all files in the package and
      use Lintian::Collect information.  The hash was being reused across
      packages, possibly leading to excessive memory consumption and false
      negatives for archive-wide runs.
  * checks/menus:
    + [RA] Keep the hash of files and symlinks local to each package,
      reducing memory consumption and false negatives for archive-wide
      runs.
  * checks/patch-systems.desc:
    + [RA] Improve the patch-system-but-direct-changes-in-diff long
      description.  (Closes: #496516)
  * checks/rules{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Remove desktop-file-but-no-dh_desktop-call.  The only action of
      dh_desktop is now checked by desktop-mimetype-without-update-call;
      dh_desktop is unnecessary with other *.desktop files.
  * checks/scripts{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Overhaul checking of maintainer script and config interpreters:
      - postrm scripts must use an essential interpreter.
      - Only preinst scripts require Pre-Depends; Depends is sufficient for
        postinst and prerm scripts.  (Closes: #508307)
      - Separate unknown-control-interpreter from unusual-interpreter
        since it's much more likely to be an error.
      - Separate control-interpreter-in-usr-local from
        interpreter-in-usr-local since the severity is higher.
      - unusual-control-interpreter is certain, not possible.
      - Suppress some cases of multiple tags about the same basic problem.
    + [RA] Check for scripts in /etc that call init scripts directly
      without using invoke-rc.d.  Based on a patch by Raphael Geissert.
      (Closes: #381485)
    + [RA] Allow dpkg-dev to satisfy a make dependency.  (Closes: #510190)
    + [ADB] More intelligently remove comments from shell scripts, to avoid
      removing some constructs that aren't comments, such as those in
      [ $# -gt 2 ] and "foo # bar".
    + [ADB] Flag the source bashism when its argument is quoted or a bare
      filename.
  * checks/watch-file:
    + [RA] Recognize additional SourceForge URLs and recommend the
      redirector.  Thanks, Riccardo Stagni.  (Closes: #510398)

  * collection/copyright-file:
    + [RA] Copy copyright files that are relative links, provided that the
      link is safe, and otherwise treat symlinked copyright files as if
      they were empty.  Fixes a Lintian crash on packages where the
      copyright file is a relative symlink.

  * debian/copyright:
    + [RA] Add an explicit key to initials used in changelog entries.
  * debian/rules:
    + [RA] New check-tag target which runs all test cases in the new test
      suite that check for or against a particular tag.

  * data/debhelper/filename-config-files:
    + [RA] New file listing debhelper config files containing filenames.

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [RA] When processing the entire archive, do so in sorted order.

  * private/update-never-seen:
    + [RA] Merge data from both test suites and use the tag files for the
      old test suite rather than relying on runtests -v.

  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [RA] We only care about the first line of the archive timestamp.

  * t/runtests:
    + [RA] Check that a test produces all tags listed in Test-For and
      doesn't produce any tags listed in Test-Against.
    + [RA] Support finding and running all tests for or against a
      particular tag.
    + [RA] Correctly set up non-native packages for dpkg-source.
  * t/tests/README:
    + [RA] Add documentation of the new test suite.

lintian (2.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Summary of tag changes:

      - debian-watch-file-specifies-wrong-upstream-version
      - debian-watch-file-specifies-old-upstream-version
      - extended-description-is-probably-too-short
      - shlib-without-versioned-soname

  * checks/description{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Check for extended descriptions shorter than three lines; they
      probably don't contain enough information.  Patch from Raphael
      Geissert.
  * checks/files{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Exclude __init__.py files and Doxygen-generated *.map files
      from zero-byte-file-in-doc-directory.  Improve the tag description
      to add a rationale and a suggestion for when overrides are
      appropriate.  Lower the certainty to possible.  (Closes: #507273)
    + [RA] Move the check for override files in the wrong location so that
      the check for subdirectories of /usr/share/lintian/overrides works
      and improve the tag description.
  * checks/nmu:
    + [RA] Recognize Ubuntu native packages by the target distribution and
      suppress NMU tags for them.  Based on a patch by Adrien Cunin.
      (Closes: #507740)
  * checks/shared-libs{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Remove special shlibs exception for NSS modules.  libc6 now
      includes shlibs entries for them.
    + [RA] Report a more specialized tag for shared libraries with SONAMEs
      that have no version and exclude them from the shlibs file tests
      since they cannot be represented there.  Reported by Raphael
      Hertzog.  (Closes: #506673)
    + [RA] Use the same regexes as dpkg-shlibdeps when parsing version
      information from SONAMEs.
  * checks/version-substvars:
    + [RA] Skip version substvar checks when the dependency is on a
      package whose name is formed by expanding substvars at build time.
      Thanks, Bastian Blank.  (Closes: #507763)
  * checks/watch-file{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Merge a set of changes by Raphael Geissert:
      - Correctly parse multiple line continuations.
      - Don't attempt any detailed checks on version one watch files.
      - Recognize versionmangle in addition to [du]versionmangle.
      - Add line information to some of the tags.
      - Detect watch files that specify SourceForge download servers
        directly and suggest use of the QA sf.net redirector instead.
      - Detect watch files specifying an upstream version that matches a
        non-native Debian package version in debian/changelog.
      - Detect watch files specifying an upstream version for an older
        changelog entry when the current changelog entry has a newer
        upstream version.

  * data/changelog-file/ubuntu-dists:
    + [RA] New shared list of Ubuntu distributions.

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [RA] Recognize Ubuntu native packages by the target distribution and
      check them against the correct set of distributions.  Based on a
      patch by Adrien Cunin.  (Closes: #507740)

  * lib/Lab.pm:
    + [ADB] Ensure that the output of unpack/list-*pkg is correctly captured
      so that the reporting harness can use the information to decide which
      packages to process in an incremental run.
  * lib/Lintian/Data.pm:
    + [RA] New all() method that returns all valid keywords.
  * lib/Read_pkglists.pm:
    + [JP] Add a new "source version" field to binary and udeb info files.
      Bump binary and udeb format version to 3 and 2 respectively.

  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [JP] Group packages by source version instead of binary version.
      (Closes: #507849)
  * reporting/templates/maintainer.tmpl:
    + [ADB] Print tags affecting udeb packages under a heading for that
      package, rather than merging them in to whichever binary package
      was last displayed (or the source package if the udeb is first
      alphabetically).
    + [ADB] Separate tags affecting a binary package from those of a source
      package with the same name when the binary is the first package produced
      from the source for which there are issues.
    + [JP] Include binary package version in subtitles when it isn't the same
      as the source version.

  * t/runtests:
    + [RA] Parameterize the package section in the skeleton.

  * unpack/list-{bin,udeb}pkg:
    + [JP] Extract source package version from source field.

lintian (2.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Summary of tag changes:
    + Added
      - latest-debian-changelog-entry-changed-to-native

  * checks/changelog{,.desc}:
    + [ADB] Warn when the version of a package changes to Debian native.
      Based on a patch by Michal Čihař.  (Closes: #504070)
  * checks/fields.desc:
    + [RA] Improve the recommendation for dependencies in debug packages
      to include the case of a debug package corresponding to multiple
      other packages.
  * checks/files:
    + [ADB] Add tests for several more embedded PHP libraries.  Patch
      by Raphael Geissert.
  * checks/patch-systems{,.desc}:
    + [ADB] Don't complain about a missing quilt build-dependency if
      the package contains a directory named debian/patches/series.
      (Closes: #507761)
    + [ADB] Lower the severity of {quilt-,d}patch-missing-description from
      minor to wishlist.
  * checks/scripts:
    + [ADB] Enhance the test for command-with-path-in-maintainer-script to
      better match executions of the command rather than the use of its name
      in pattern matching expressions.  (Closes: #499847)

  * collection/{fileinfo,md5sums}:
    + [ADB] Use blocking filehandles to pass the list of filenames to check
      to the spawned file / md5sum.  By default the handles were non-blocking
      which could lead to problems with larger file lists.  (Closes: #507461)

  * debian/{control,copyright}:
    + [ADB] Add Adam D. Barratt to Uploaders and copyright.

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [ADB] Don't call lintian-info when --info is specified.  Set a new
      flag on the Lintian::Output module instead.
  * frontend/lintian-info:
    + [ADB] Add missing "use Text_Utils".  It used to be indirectly pulled
      in via Read_taginfo.

    + [ADB] Flag a tag as issued when printing it.
  * lib/Lintian/Output.pm:

      attempting to use it.  Thanks, gregor herrmann.  (Closes: #507241)
    + [ADB] Maintain a list of tags which have been issued.
    + [ADB] Optionally include the description of a tag when displaying it.
  * lib/Lintian/Output/ColonSeparated.pm:
    + [ADB] Fix uninitialized value warnings by displaying the type code
      rather than the (no longer present in description files) Type field
      and handling non-overridden tags.
  * lib/Lintian/Output/LetterQualifier.pm:
    + [ADB] Optionally include the description of a tag when displaying it.
  * lib/Lintian/Output/XML.pm:
    + [ADB] Add a missing angle bracket to the closing "tag" tag, so that
      the XML is well-formed.

  * lib/Lab.pm:
    + [FL] Fix breakage of populate_with_dist() I introduced in 2.1.0.
  * lib/Read_taginfo.pm:
    + [ADB] Move the work of formatting a tag's description to a separate
      function so that it can be called from multiple locations.
    + [ADB] Properly export those functions which are called from other
      modules.
  * lib/Spelling.pm:
    + [RA] Don't add unnecessary backslashes in the list of spelling
      corrections.  They're copied into the output.  Thanks, Micah
      Anderson.  (Closes: #507331)
  * lib/Tags.pm:
    + [ADB] Don't output a "Processing binary package foo.changes" message.
      Thanks Sandro Tosi for pointing the issue out.

      - quilt-patch-missing-description
      - shlib-calls-exit

  * checks/common_data.pm:
    + [FL] New variable $known_shells_regex which matches known shell
      names.  This removes some synchronisation issues between the
      different regexes in use.
  * checks/debconf{,.desc}:
    + [CW] Update my e-mail address.
    + [ADB] Don't detect the use of "?" as a literal character or wildcard
      as part of a question in an extended template description.  Based
      on a patch by Stephen Gran.  (Closes: #500661)
  * checks/debhelper:
    + [FL] Use Lintian::Data for list of debhelper commands that modify
      maintainer scripts.  Patch by Raphael Geissert.
    + [FL] Add new tag missing-build-dependency-for-dh_-command for
      debhelper commands that are not from the debhelper package.
      Patch by Raphael Geissert.
    + [FL] Add new tag debhelper-but-no-misc-depends which warns
      about missing misc:Depends if you use commands that might
      set it.  Patch by Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #499737)
  * checks/fields:
    + [ADB] Ignore non-dependency fields when considering whether a
      versioned dependency is satisfied by the perl core packages.
      Based on a patch by Niko Tyni.  (Closes: #500720)
    + [RA] Stop checking for a libmodule-build-perl build dependency since
      Module::Build now comes with Perl.  Thanks, Raphael Hertzog.
      (Closes: #506697)
  * checks/files:
    + [ADB] Apply patches from Raphael Geissert to update the list of
      embedded PHP libraries:
      - Add detection for the Snoopy and GeSHi libraries and the use of
        phpmailer.inc (rather than .php).
      - Enable the libmarkdown-php check, as the package is now in unstable.
      - Add support for the (not currently packaged and thus disabled) IXR
        and kses libraries.
  * checks/infofiles:
    + [FL] Use $known_shells_regex from common_data.
  * checks/menus:
    + [FL] Use $known_shells_regex from common_data.
  * checks/patch-systems{,.desc}:
    + [ADB] Don't include dpatch comment lines containing no content
      when determining whether the patch includes a description.
      (Closes: #503695)
    + [ADB] Add missing "diffstat" to the Needs-Info field.
    + [ADB] Check whether quilt patches include a description.
      (Closes: #498892)
  * check/scripts:
    + [FL] Use $known_shells_regex from common_data.

    + [ADB] Don't issue both symbols-file-contains-debian-revision and
      symbols-file-contains-current-version-with-debian-revision for any
      given symbol, as the latter implies the former and may thus create
      noise in the tests' output.  (Closes: #505826)
    + [ADB] Add an experimental tag flagging shared libraries that call
      _exit() or exit() without at some point calling fork() (a somewhat
      inaccurate heuristic, but one which should weed out a number of
      false positives).  (Closes: #504257)

  * collection/objdump-info:
    + [ADB] Only use readelf to emulate objdump if objdump returned "file
      format not recognized".  In cases where the objdump output was "invalid
      operation", the output of etch's readelf is not particularly useful
      and it's easier to simply let the checks scripts handle the objdump
      output.

  * debian/control:
    + [FL] Add dependency on libipc-run-perl for Lintian::Command.

  * doc/lintian.sgml:
    + [ADB] Correct a few typos in the "overrides" section.

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [FL] Convert to use Lintian::Output.

      the EOLed edgy and feisty.

      for the overridden tag hasn't been run (or --tags was used and
      the overridden tag not specified).  (Closes: #501722)

  * lib/Lintian/Output:
    + [FL] New module to bundle output methods.
  * lib/Tags/{ColonSeparated,LetterQualifier}.pm:
    + [FL] Move to lib/Lintian/Output and convert to subclasses of
      Lintian::Output.
  * lib/Lintian/Output/XML.pm:
    + [FL] New experimental output format.
  * lib/Lintian/Command:
    + [FL] New utility module as a replacement for Pipeline. Provides
      a convenient wrapper around IPC::Run.

  * lib/Lab.pm:
    + [FL] Convert to use Lintian::Output.
  * lib/Tags.pm:
    + [FL] Convert to use Lintian::Output.
  * lib/Pipeline.pm:
    + [FL] Remove, replaced by Lintian::Command.

      Thanks, Sandro Tosi.  (Closes: #506793)
    + [ADB] Don't check text contained within square brackets for
      capitalisation mistakes.  This allows for lists such as "[ cvs |
      subversion ]" to be included.
  * lib/Util.pm:
    + [FL] Convert to use Lintian::Output.
    + [FL] Add some new utility functions: delete_dir copy_dir gunzip_file
      touch_file.

  * private/refresh-debhelper-data:

    + [RA] Check for a maintainer also listed in uploaders.  Patch from

    + [ADB] Don't issue an error tag for obsolete packages in Build-Depends
      fields if the package is part of an "ORed group" of packages and is
      not listed first.  As with Depends, an info tag will still be issued
      for such packages.  (Closes: #496875)

        thus disabled.
      - Add experimental check for embedded copies of PEAR PHP modules.
    + [ADB] Rework the description for embedded-javascript-library to make
      it clear that the listed libraries are examples rather than an
      exclusive list.  Also fix a spelling mistake.

      Javascript libraries, removing some false positives.  (Closes: #497215)

      but there are reported false positives for the current
      expressions.
    + [RA] Improve the check for possibly insecure /tmp files to check
      variable assignment as well and reduce false positives by ignoring
      uses with $RANDOM or without a filename.  Based on a patch from
      Raphael Geissert.
    + [FL] Update lists of available interpreter versions (remove: jruby1.1,

      Based on a patch from Raphael Geissert.

    + [FL] Document wildcard support in overrides.

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [RA] Ensure we close the pipe to lintian-info before exiting, since
      otherwise lintian-info may print the rest of our output after
      lintian exits, producing confusing output interleaved with the
      shell prompt.  (Closes: #496295)
    + [FL] Actually make package version available to output formatters.
      Currently used only by experimental colon-separated output.
    + [FL] Use new module Lintian::Schedule and make package architecture

      (Closes: #253884)
  * lib/Tags/ColonSeparated.pm:
    + [FL] Update for new features and make a little bit easier to read
      for humans:
      - Update the format to include the new severity/certainty info.
      - Include information whether the tag is experimental.
      - Move the detailed override info to the end but include info
        flag about the override status in the same column that also
        includes the experimental flag info.
  * lib/Lintian/Schedule.pm:
    + [FL] Factor out some scheduling code.
  * lib/Lintian/Data.pm:
    + [FL] Extend Lintian::Data to handle key/value pairs.  Patch by
      Niko Tyni.

    + [ADB] Don't list packages in the summary at the top of the main
      report page if all of the issues reported for the package were
      "info" or "experimental".  (Closes: #498617)

  * t/runtests:
    + [FL] Copy the changes to testset/runtests from JP's branch.
    + [FL] Remove global tests that were duplicated from testset/runtests,
      which will not go away in the foreseeable future.
    + [FL] Print a warning if no tests were run.  Based on a patch by
      Raphael Geissert.

    + [ADB] Use Lintian::Collect instead of reading the fields/*, file-info
      and objdump-info files.
    + [ADB] Remove a misplaced word from the description of the tag
      "debian-changelog-file-contains-invalid-email-address".
  * checks/copyright-file{,.desc}:
    + [ADB] Drop the "copyright line too long" check.  Most of the issues
      it flags aren't easily fixable, particularly where the copyright file
      is (semi)automatically generated.  (Closes: #491302, #491365, #491685)
    + [ADB] Use Lintian::Collect for accessing control fields and reading the

      License) as missing a reference to common-licenses
    + [ADB] Replace references to the GPL in GFDL and LGPL related tags
      with the appropriate license.  Also remove a misplaced word.
  * checks/cruft:
    + [ADB] Use Lintian::Collect for accessing control fields
  * checks/debconf:

      (Closes: #491135)
    + [RA] Try to recognize at least some debconf template uses in Perl.

    + [ADB] Don't flag the shared templates used for dictionaries-common

    + [ADB] Use Lintian::Collect::field() to determine the content of fields

      Collect object caches the lookup result.
    + [ADB] Reformat a couple of tags' descriptions.
  * checks/files{,.desc}:
    + [ADB] Switch to using Lintian::Collect.
    + [ADB] Fix a couple of bugs in the parsing of the list of scripts

      desktop files.  Patch from Raphael Geissert.

      Jordà Polo.
  * checks/patch-systems:
    + [RA] Combine all patch-system-but-direct-changes-in-diff instances
      into a single message to reduce the noise from packages that rebuild

  * checks/scripts{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Warn about maintainer scripts that prepend a path to commands.
      Based on a patch by Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #376184)
    + [ADB] Don't read fields/*, scripts, index or file-info directly as the
      contents have almost certainly been cached in Lintian::Collect already.
    + [ADB] Update a couple of Policy references.  Thanks Jordà Polo.
  * checks/shared-libs.{,desc}:
    + [ADB] Improve the description of no-symbols-control-file.
    + [ADB] Migrate to using ::Collect instead of parsing the index, file-info
      and objdump-info files directly.
    + [ADB] Disable ldconfig-symlink-before-shlib-in-deb as it can never be
      tested correctly using the information currently available to the

      empty watch files.

      run not by check names but by names of tags you're interested
      in.  Requested by Joerg Jaspert for ftpmaster.  (Closes: #493903)
    + [FL] Add --tags-from-file option to make it easier to specify
      a long list of tags.

  * lib/Lintian/Collect/Binary.pm:
    + [ADB] When parsing objdump-info, indicate whether a shared object is
      an Ocaml executable.  Also add information on segments which various

    + [ADB] Add support for parsing the "scripts" index file

    + [ADB] Detect debconf templates which appear to be unused.
    + [ADB] Replace the {config,postinst}-loads-obsolete-confmodule tags
      with a new loads-obsolete-confmodule test which is used for all
      maintainer scripts and outputs the script name as part of its extra data.

      Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #424746)

      non-obsolete alternatives specified and if the obsolete

      positives.  Downgrades #485885 to wishlist.  Also see
      #175467.  Patch by Raphael Geissert.
    + [FL] Remove "quoted quotes". They're likely to be inside
      another pair of quotes; we're not interested in
      them for their own sake and removing them makes finding
      the limits of the outer pair far easier.  Patch by
      Adam D. Barratt.

      the package itself (Closes: #461575)
  * checks/standards-version{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Only issue out-of-date-standards-version once.  Noticed by
      Raphael Geissert.
    + [RA] Base the two-year clock for ancient-standards-version on when
      the Policy version was superseded, not when it was issued.  Thanks,
      Scott Kitterman.  (Closes: #487780)
    + [RA] Warn for packages declaring a standards version released after
      the date of the most recent changelog entry.  Based on a patch by
      Raphael Geissert.
  * checks/watch-file{,.desc}:
    + [FL] Check for more Debian specific strings in version
      number.  Issue an info tag if the watch file uses
      uversionsmangle to add the Debian specific string. Patch
      by Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #485879)
    + [RA] Warn about watch files in native packages and check those watch
      files for other problems anyway.  Allow whitespace around the
      version declaration.  More correctly handle continuation lines.
      Patch from Raphael Geissert.
    + [RA] Check for using the Sourceforge QA redirector with deprecated
      arguments.  Patch from Raphael Geissert.
    + [RA] Be more explicit when warning about missing watch files that
      Lintian recommends adding a watch file containing only comments for
      any non-native package where it's not possible to write a meaningful
      watch file, not only for packages unmaintained upstream.

  * collection/objdump-info:
    + [ADB] If objdump from binutils 2.17 fails to parse a file then
      attempt to gather the required information using readelf instead.

      (i.e. on lintian.d.o)  (Closes: #487746)

  * data/fields/obsolete-packages:
    + [RA] mailx is not obsolete.  It's a virtual package.  Thanks, martin
      f krafft.  (Closes: #488114)
    + [RA] Add the cupsys packages, all of which have been renamed to cups.
      Patch from Raphael Geissert.

  * debian/control:
    + [FL] Adapt VCS-* headers for move from SVN to git.

  * debian/{prerm,postrm}:
    + [RA] Move prerm to postrm and remove the default /var/spool/lintian
      lab using shell instead of lintian.  We only want to remove the lab
      on purge, and purge is only passed to postrm, not prerm, by which
      point the lintian frontend is gone.  (Closes: #489860)

  * doc/CREDITS:
    + [FL] Add Raphael Geissert and Adam D. Barratt.
  * doc/lintian.sgml:
    + [ADB] Add reference to new option to display experimental tags.

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [ADB] Add a new --show-experimental / -E option which indicates
      that experimental tags should be displayed.
    + [RA] Exit with the correct exit status if no packages were found
      because non-existent packages were specified on the command line.

  * lib/Lintian/Collect/Binary.pm:
    + [FL] Add support for file-info file.
    + [FL] Add support for objdump-info file.
  * lib/Spelling.pm:

      checks for LaTeX and TeX.  Thanks, Raphael Geissert.

  * man/lintian.1:
    + [FL] Document watch-file check.
    + [ADB] Document new option to display experimental tags.
    + [RA] Refer to lintian-info(1) for printing tag descriptions.  Patch
      from Chris Lamb.  (Closes: #490374)

      With layout help by Jordà Polo.

lintian (1.24.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The "mostly for the benefit of lintian.debian.org only" release.

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [FL] Increase LAB_FORMAT to 8. This should have happened
      in 1.23.47, since the unpack-binpkg-l1 then produced a
      new file which checks depend upon.  Since this only
      affects static labs and only if packages get rechecked
      (i.e. not on harness -i runs) it only got noticed now.
      Use urgency=medium for this fix.

  * checks/watch-file:
    + [FL] Fix the order of two regular expression to use
      the more specific one first.  Patch by Raphael Geissert.
      (Closes: #485884)

  * unpack/unpack-binpkg-l1:
    + [FL] Don't include version number from Source: field in
      the source symlink.  Noted by RA.  (Closes: #485474)

  * lib/Lintian/Collect/Binary.pm:
    + [FL] New module for retrieving binary package information.

  * reporting/checkout-release:
    + [FL] New helper script for lintian.d.o maintenance.
  * reporting/config:
    + [FL] Generate files in $HOME/www directly instead
      of $HOME/www/reports.
  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [FL] Allow inclusion of the new shared templates by
      convenient functions. Remove some duplicated data
      setting while I'm on it.
    + [FL] Generate the manual and lintian.log symlinks
      dynamically, so that we don't need the reports subdirectory
      anymore.  Also generate a reports -> . symlink for
      backwards compatibility.
  * reporting/templates/{head,foot}.tmpl:
    + [FL] New templates meant for inclusion by other templates
      for common header and footer parts
  * reporting/templates/index.tmpl:
    + [FL] Remove obsolete reports/ subdirectory from the links.
  * reporting/templates/maintainer.tmpl:
    + [RA] Redisplay the tag name for each separate binary package, also
      fixing list nesting problems in some cases.  Patch from Jordà
      Polo.
  * reporting/templates/*.tmpl:
    + [FL] Replace common headers/footers with calls to the
      new head()/foot() functions.

lintian (1.24.0) unstable; urgency=low

  The "Policy 3.8.0, infrastructure evolution, and real web design"
  release.

  * checks/binaries:
    + [RA] Fix code for filtering out NSS modules from SONAME checks.
    + [RA] When checking SONAMEs against package names, convert all
      underscores to dashes, not just the first one.  Thanks, Gonéri Le
      Bouder.  (Closes: #482450)
    + [RA] Remove several-sonames-in-same-package.  This is frequently not
      an error and Lintian doesn't have enough information to know.
  * checks/common_data.pm:
    + [RA] armel is now a standard architecture.
    + [RA] Remove %known_obsolete_packages, now handled via data.
    + [RA] Merge %non_standard_archs into %known_archs.
  * checks/control-file{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check for self-dependencies in the source package since the
      current dpkg-gencontrol silently fixes them but they may indicate
      other problems.  Thanks, Patrick Matthäi.  (Closes: #471740)
  * checks/copyright-file{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check for copyright files containing the Apache 2.0 license,
      which is now in common-licenses.
  * checks/cruft:
    + [RA] Format: 3.0 (quilt) packages are not native even though they
      have no *.diff.gz.  Thanks, Raphael Hertzog.  (Closes: #483384)
    + [RA] Use the new Lintian::Collect interface to check whether a
      package is native.
  * checks/debconf:
    + [RA] Don't warn about using db_input in postinst if a config script
      also exists and uses db_input.  The package maintainer probably
      knows what they're doing.
  * checks/fields:
    + [RA] Syntax-check Breaks like other relationship fields.  Warn if
      any packages use Breaks for right now.  Only check for duplicate
      libraries and Tcl versions in dependency fields, not Breaks,
      Conflicts, and other similar fields.  Warn if Breaks is used without
      a version.  Check that Breaks is not inconsistent with other
      dependency fields.
    + [RA] Use Lintian::Data to load the obsolete package list.
    + [RA] When checking whether a debug package has proper dependencies,
      allow a dependency on any package name that starts the same as the
      debug package up to the first dash.  This will hopefully produce
      fewer false positives.  Thanks, Josselin Mouette.  (Closes: #476587)
    + [RA] Remove non-standard-architecture-in-source-relation and
      non-standard-architecture.  These aren't bugs.
  * checks/filenames{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Warn about BTS data directories in packages (.be and
      .ditrack).  Patch by Ben Finney.  (Closes: #481787)
  * checks/init.d:
    + [RA] Try to allow for postinst scripts written in Perl and still
      recognize the update-rc.d calls.
  * checks/manpages{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Only ignore errors about wrapping lines for Asian locale man
      pages, since that's where the groff trouble lies.  Ignore character
      set errors for all man pages with old versions of man and no man
      pages with current versions of man since the new character set
      handling should cope.  (Closes: #474052)
    + [FL] Ignore more unicode issues with old man.
    + [RA] Warn about inclusion of the country name in the localized man
      page directory unless it's one of the known exceptions.
    + [RA] Mention in binary-without-manpage that the case of the man page
      should match the case of the binary even if man can find it anyway.
      (Closes: #484028)
  * checks/md5sums:
    + [FL] Don't complain about missing md5sums file if the
      package only contains conffiles.  (Closes: #482869)
  * checks/nmu:
    + [RA] Don't treat "Ack NMU" as an NMU declaration.  Thanks, Joe
      Nahmias.  (Closes: #484600)
    + [RA] Binary NMUs of QA-maintained packages are fine.
  * checks/rules{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Add some basic checks for whether debhelper programs are called
      in a reasonable order.  (Closes: #471869)
    + [RA] Support pattern rules.  (Closes: #483475)
  * checks/scripts:
    + [RA] Catch deprecated chown syntax even when options are given to
      chown.  Patch by Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #483775)
    + [RA] $((var+1)) now works in dash and is in POSIX, so remove it from
      bashisms.  Patch by Adam D. Barratt.  (Closes: #473156)
  * checks/standards-version{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Largely rewritten.  Now contains a list of standards versions
      with the date when they were released, adding 3.8.0.  Only emit tag
      out-of-date-standards-version if the newer version predates the date
      of the package.  Base ancient-standards-version on whether the
      standards version of the package is more than two years old.  Remove
      package-declares-source-relation-but-has-older-standards-version;
      policy 3.1.0 was a long time ago.  (Closes: #472513)
  * checks/watch-file{.desc,}:
    + [RA] New checks for watch files, based on work by Patrick
      Schoenfeld.  (Closes: #234202, #409104, #456629, #472499)

  * data/fields/obsolete-packages:
    + [RA] Moved from common_data.pm.  Removed many very old packages that
      nothing depends on and added many new packages identified by Riku
      Voipio.  (Closes: #475400)

  * debian/control:
    + [RA] Update standards version to 3.8.0.
    + [RA] Depend on libtimedate-perl for convenient date parsing.

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [RA] Create a new Lintian::Collect object for each package being
      checked and pass it into Checker::runcheck.

  * lib/Checker.pm:
    + [RA] Pass a Lintian::Collect object as the third argument to the run
      function of each check.
  * lib/Lintian/Collect.pm:
    + [RA] New module to retrieve package information.
  * lib/Lintian/Collect/Source.pm:
    + [RA] New module to retrieve source package information.

  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [RA] Copy over images.  Set the maintainer name to "Unknown
      Maintainer" if not known.  Pass the code for a tag into the per-tag
      page.  Based on a patch by Jordà Polo.
  * reporting/images/*:
    + [RA] New logo images from Jordà Polo.
  * reporting/lintian.css:
    + [RA] Significant overhaul of the lintian.d.o design by Jordà Polo.
  * reporting/templates/*:
    + [RA] Significant overhaul of the lintian.d.o design by Jordà Polo.
  * reporting/templates/clean.tmpl:
    + [FL] Include link to full maintainer report.  Suggested by
      Kartik Mistry.

lintian (1.23.49) unstable; urgency=low

  The "Business as usual" release.

  * checks/binaries:
    + [FL] Ignore rpaths to directories present in the same binary
      package.  Also ignore $ORIGIN since that obviously fulfills
      that criterion.  (Closes: #480636)
  * checks/copyright-file{,.desc}:
    + [FL] Implement new check for dh-make-perl boilerplate.
    + [FL] New check for example URL from dh-make.  Based on
      a patch by Michal Čihař.  (Closes: #481368)
  * checks/debhelper:
    + [FL] dh_lintian needs debhelper >= 6.0.7. Patch by David Paleino.
      (Closes: #479088)
    + [FL] Add basic support for debhelpers new dh utility.
      (Closes: #477628)
    + [FL] Suppress maintainer-script-lacks-debhelper-token for
      single-udeb-only packages as well.  (Closes: #471853)
  * checks/files:
    + [FL] Drop xresources-file-in-etc-without-proper-conflicts, since
      the last package that conflict applies to was released with hamm!
      Reported by Julien Cristau.  (Closes: #480574)
  * checks/menu-format:
    + [FL] Don't issue false positives about menu files in format menu-2.
      We don't check them for errors yet, though.  (Closes: #478578)
  * checks/patch-systems:
    + [FL] Add basic support for dpatch list files which use cpp for
      preprocessing.  Patch by Jörg Sommer.  (Closes: #477057)
  * checks/scripts:
    + [FL] Always use /bin/bash for shell script syntax check to give
      consistent errors on systems with changed /bin/sh.  Suggested
      by Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #478192)

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [FL] Don't issue a warning about Distribution: UNRELEASED in
      .changes files.  It can be annoying to have to ignore this error
      during testing and dupload/dput/dak/etc... all will error out
      on it anyway.  Suggested by martin f krafft.  (Closes: #382327)
    + [FL] Add a --keep-lab option to make it easier to debug temporary
      labs.  (Closes: #401046)

  * lib/Util.pm:
    + [FL] Only require Digest::SHA if the code path is really used.
      This makes it unnecessary to install libdigest-sha-perl on
      lintian.debian.org for now.

  * man/lintian.1:
    + [FL] Document --keep-lab option.
    + [FL] Fix error in checkname: s/patch-system/patch-systems/.
      Reported by Jörg Sommer.

  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [FL] Escape $email variable for usage in URI query strings.
      Currently it is not used for anything else, so it is most simple
      to do it in the actual code.  Reported by Sandro Tosi.
      (Closes: #481256)

      to Pre-Depends.

    + [RA] Stop using a deprecated Perl construct that Perl 5.10 no longer
      supports.  Patch from Adam D. Barratt.  (Closes: #479318)
  * checks/shared-libs:
    + [RA] Fix an unescaped | in the regular expression parsing postinst
      files for ldconfig invocation.  The regex had always been broken,
      but in Perl 5.10 it causes a recursion error in the regex engine.
  * checks/version-substvars:
    + [FL] Also apply the "not-binnmuable-*" checks to Pre-Depends.
      (Closes: #472247)

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [RA] Work around a Perl 5.10 bug with Getopt::Long and sub handlers.

  * testset/runtests:
    + [RA] dpkg-source now enables the -i and -I regexes by default.
      Replace the defaults with ones that never match so that we can
      continue testing for cruft left in source packages.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun, 04 May 2008 12:57:48 -0700

lintian (1.23.47) unstable; urgency=low

  The "long time no upload" release.

  * checks/binaries{.desc,}
    + [RA] Permit architecture: all packages to have binaries in the
      multiarch directories.  (Closes: #469301)
    + [RA] Suggest an override for arch: all packages containing binaries
      independent of the host architecture (such as for cross-compiles).
  * checks/changelog-file:
    + [RA] Quash more Perl warnings on badly malformed NEWS.Debian files.
  * checks/control-files:
    + [FL] Add 'triggers' as a valid control file.  Thanks, Joey Hess.

      license references and catch the GFDL 1.1 false positive.
    + [FL] Add CeCILL license to false positives list for
      copyright-should-refer-to-common-license-file-for-gpl.  Thanks,
      Alexandre Fayolle.  (Closes: #472933)
  * checks/cruft:
    + [RA] Subversion conflicts generate three files, two with revision
      numbers and one with .mine.  Only warn about the revision numbers;
      .mine probably won't occur alone and may be a false positive.
  * checks/etcfiles:
    + [RA] /etc/init.d/{skeleton,rc,rcS} are not conffiles, and README
      files in /etc need not be.
  * checks/fields.desc:
    + [FL] Remove obsolete section base from list of valid sections in
      unknown-section.  (Closes: #471751)

      static ranges.  Patch from Håkon Stordahl.  (Closes: #469924)
    + [RA] Issue errors for installing files under /var/www.  This isn't
      in FHS, may not be the document root, and may break local files if
      it is the document root.  Thanks, Joerg Jaspert.  (Closes: #470403)
    + [RA] Don't consider files in bin directories that contain "copying"
      or "license" to be extra license files.
    + [FL] Don't complain about empty directories under
      /usr/share/python-support since those might be needed.  Thanks,
      Josselin Mouette.  (Closes: #473428)

      a variation of the word "incorporate."
  * checks/scripts:
    + [RA] Attempt to quash some Perl warnings.
    + [RA] *.py files in /usr/{lib,share}, /etc/init.d/skeleton, and *.ex
      files do not need to be executable even if they look like scripts.
    + [RA] Add clisp, procmail, and rrdcgi, and another way interpreters
      are templated in *.in files.
    + [RA] Expect unversioned dependencies on OCaml packages rather than
      versioned dependencies since the version changes frequently and
      unversioned dependencies are what people are already using.  Thanks,
      Hideki Yamane.  (Closes: #476417)
    + [RA] Add inetutils-inetd and xinetd as additional update-inetd
      providers.  Patch from Guillem Jover.  (Closes: #474077)
    + [RA] If the call to some supporting program like update-inetd is
      conditional on the existence of the program, assume the maintainer
      knows what they're doing and don't warn.
  * checks/shared-libs:
    + [RA] Move the default ld.so search path into data.  Drop obsolete
      /usr/lib/libg++-dbg, /usr/X11R6/lib/Xaw3d, and libc5 compatibility
      directories in the process.

    + [RA] New file listing directories searched by ld.so.

    + [FL] Add dependency on libdigest-sha-perl.
    + [FL] Increase debhelper dependency to >= 5

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [RA] Qualify relative --root directories so that we don't break
      later.  Patch from Håkon Stordahl.  (Closes: #469925)
    + [CW] Add intrepid as an allowable distribution for Ubuntu.
    + [FL] Support Checksums-* fields in .changes files. Follows
      the same rules as the md5sum check. Add new option --checksums

  * lib/Spelling.pm:
    + [RA] Avoid Perl warnings when called with an uninitialized value.

      by Hideki Yamane. (Closes: #474478)
    + [FL] Add new --checksums option.

  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [RA] Base the generation of clean report pages on the maintainer URL
      rather than the full maintainer string so that maintainers with
      different forms of their name won't have clean reports that
      overwrite dirty ones.
    + [RA] Fix the counts in qa-list.txt, which were broken in several
      respects.
    + [RA] Don't consider a maintainer's page error/warning free if there
      are errors or warnings in their co-maintained packages.
  * reporting/templates/maintainer.tmpl:
    + [RA] Always add anchors to the package names even for uploaders.

  * testset/copyright:
    + [FL] New testcases by Tobias Toedter.  (Closes: #472665)

  The "five Lintian committers!" release.

  * checks/binaries:
    + [RA] Anchor file matches for Perl libraries and debugging symbols so
      as to not match partial paths.  Based on a patch from Niko Tyni.
      (Closes: #466501)

      distclean are ignored.  Thanks, Jörg Sommer.  (Closes: #469024)
  * checks/changelog-file:
    + [RA] Adjust for the extra space added by Parse::DebianChangelog when
      checking line length.  Thanks, Robert Millan.  (Closes: #467019)
  * checks/common_data.pm:
    + [RA] Accept (and ignore for now) the new Checksums-Sha1,
      Checksums-Sha256, and Checksums-Md5 fields in source packages.
      Thanks, Raphael Hertzog.  (Closes: #466979)
  * checks/control-file:
    + [RA] Skip empty dependencies for stronger-dependency-implies-weaker.
  * checks/control-files{.desc,}:
    + [FL] Warn about empty control files. I can't see any use for
      them. Exclude udebs though, since they might differ there.
  * checks/copyright-file{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Tests for copyright notices must be case-insensitive.  Patch
      from Chris Lamb.  (Closes: #464992)
    + [RA] When looking for cases where Copyright is separated from a year
      by a newline, also allow (C) before or after the newline.  Thanks,
      Michael Meskes.  (Closes: #465258)
    + [RA] Further explain why lintian looks for a valid copyright notice.

  * checks/files{.desc,}:
    + [FL,RA] Merge all the tags for vcs ignore files, inventory files,
      and vcs control dirs. Since the explanations don't actually differ,
      different tags make no sense. While at it, add the mercurial
      equivalents as well and update some of the tag descriptions. Partly
      based on a patch by Chris Lamb.
  * checks/md5sums{.desc,}:
    + [FL] Remove tag md5sums-control-file-is-empty in favour of
      a more general tag in control-files.
  * checks/manpages.desc:
    + [RA] Mention in binary-without-manpage that if the man pages are
      provided by another package on which this package depends, a lintian
      override is appropriate.
  * checks/menu-format:
    + [RA] When the menu or desktop file invokes a quoted command via an
      su program, don't try to check whether the command is in the
      package.  Thanks, Paul Wise.  (Closes: #466665)

    + [FL] Warn if a maintainer script is a valid shell script but
      doesn't seem to have any actual code.  Based on an idea
      by Justin Pryzby.  (Closes: #410042)
    + [RA] Update regexes based on checkbashisms to remove additional
      false positives and add additional checks.  Thanks, Adam D. Barratt.
    + [RA] Add kaptain.  Thanks, Tobias Toedter.  (Closes: #466701)
    + [RA] Allow zsh-beta as an alternative to zsh.  Thanks, Joost van

    + [RA] Rename sharedobject-in-library-directory-not-actually-a-shlib
      to sharedobject-in-library-directory-missing-soname for clarity.
      Thanks, Peter Eisentraut.  (Closes: #467425)

  * data/doc-base/sections:
    + [RA] New file listing known doc-base sections.

  * debian/dirs:
    + [RA] Install the base directory for the Lintian root here.
  * debian/rules:
    + [RA] Redo the installation rules to support arbitrary nesting under
      the copied directories.  As a side effect, install
      lib/Tags/ColonSeparated.pm, unbreaking the experimental
      colon-separated output format.

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [CW] Make the presence of an Ubuntu release name in the version number
      trigger the Ubuntu distribution field checks.
    + [RA] Fix option parsing bug leading lintian to incorrectly reject -a
      or -p without a package.

  * lib/Dep.pm:
    + [RA] Skip empty dependencies, avoiding false positives for
      stronger-dependency-implies-weaker.  Patch from Adam D. Barratt.
      (Closes: #469222)
  * lib/Lintian/Data.pm:
    + [RA] New module for loading and querying lists of keywords.
  * lib/Read_pkglists.pm:
    + [RA] Extract Uploaders from the source package list.

    + [RA] Merriam-Webster and the OED have both given up on publically
      vs. publicly, so we should as well.  (Closes: #466617)

  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [RA] Load the correct configuration file.
    + [RA] Include packages for which one is an uploader in one's
      maintainer page, marked accordingly.  (Closes: #421011)
  * reporting/templates/*:
    + [TK] Correct Lintian maintainers address in page footers.

  * unpack/list-srcpkg:
    + [RA] Include Uploaders in the package list.
  * unpack/unpack-srcpkg-l2:
    + [RA] Don't rely on the output format of dpkg-source to learn the
      source directory and create a symlink.  Instead, tell dpkg-source to
      unpack the source directly into the unpacked directory.  Discard
      output of dpkg-source to allow for the current version, which prints
      things even with -q (fixed in later versions).  Thanks, Raphael
      Hertzog.  (Closes: #468927)

      Python build dependency.  Thanks, Joerg Jaspert.  (Closes: #464709)
  * checks/manpages:
    + [RA] Ignore another undefined macro generated by pod2man (will be
      fixed with the Pod::Man in Perl 5.10).
  * checks/po-debconf:
    + [RA] Also accept nnn_NN names for po files.  nds_DE and nds_NL are
      valid locales.  Thanks, Christian Perrier.

  * checks/copyright-file{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check the copyright file to ensure it contains at least one
      copyright statement with a date or the term "public domain".  It's
      hard to be thorough without false positives, but this should catch
      the most obvious omissions.  Thanks, Justin Pryzby and Jari Aalto.
      (Closes: #286842, #409131)
  * checks/fields:
    + [RA] Warn of build-dependencies on a Debian revision of -1.  They

    + [RA] Accept three-character language codes for po files.  Thanks,
      Patrick Winnertz and Eddy Petrișor.  (Closes: #464511)

    + [RA] Don't strip hyphens before checking spelling.  Move all D-Bus

      even if accurate without capitalization.  Thanks, Nelson A. de
      Oliveira.  (Closes: #464461)

      (Closes: #459509)

      don't depend on libc.  Patch from Niko Tyni.  (Closes: #461350)

      Tyni.  (Closes: #462456)

    + [RA] Decode the changelog entry from UTF-8 before doing length
      checks.  Thanks, Cyril Brulebois.  (Closes: #461822)
    + [RA] Check for mismatches between the latest changelog and
      NEWS.Debian entries if they're for the same package version.

    + [RA] CDBS now defaults to a debhelper compatibility level of V5.
    + [FL] Update list of debhelper commands that modify maintainer
       scripts. Add dh_icons, dh_installudev, dh_pysupport, dh_pycentral
       and rename dh_installtexfonts to dh_installtex.

      and dh_installifupdown.  Thanks, Evgeni Golov.  (Closes: #463028)

      Brulebois.  (Closes: #460168)
    + [RA] Versioned Python dependencies satisfy a Python debian/rules
      requirement.  Add a separate tag for Python build dependencies to

      Thanks, Loïc Minier.  (Closes: #460625)

      Uploaders.  Thanks, Sune Vuorela.  (Closes: #462635)
    + [RA] Remove the package-has-duplicate-relation test.  It gets
      relations with different version strictness in different levels of
      dependency wrong and what it gets right dpkg-gencontrol strips out.
  * checks/files{.desc,}:
    + [RA] In many of the long descriptions for symlink-related tags,
      mention that running dh_link will fix symlink problems.
    + [RA] Fix a long-standing error in the regex checking for *.desktop
      files in /usr/share/gnome/apps that caused the tag to never be
      issued.  Remove the check for /usr/share/applnk, since obsolete or
      not KDE appears to actively use it still.

    + [RA] Warn of more language extensions on files in the user's path.
      Patch from Chris Lamb.  (Closes: #459514)
    + [RA] Remove the tag for empty Perl directories.  The underlying
      issue is fixed in Perl 5.10; there's no need to add code to

  * checks/infofiles:
    + [RA] Don't issue unknown-interpreter for maintainer scripts with

      Thijs Kinkhorst.  (Closes: #460966)

      it's not required for functionality.  Thanks, Petter Reinholdtsen.
      (Closes: #460499)
  * checks/manpages{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Make hyphen-used-as-minus-sign more conservative to avoid false
      positives with non-ASCII text and catch hyphens at the start of
      lines.  Thanks, Michal Čihař.  (Closes: #459871)
    + [CW] Use man's new --warnings option to catch use of undefined
      strings, macros, or diversions in manual pages, which usually indicate
      mistaken use of "." or "'" at the start of a line. This check is only
      enabled if man 2.5.1 or later is installed.  (Closes: #377392)
  * checks/menu-format:
    + [RA] Avoid a Perl warning for desktop entries without Exec.
    + [RA] Fix a bug that prevented Exec keys in desktop files from being
      checked at all.  Thanks, Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #462601)

      maintain stable compatibility.  Thanks, Thomas Goirand.
    + [RA] Be clearer in the tag name that php-cli dependencies should be
      versioned.  Add more explanation to the long description of several
      interpreter tags about limitations and requested bug filings.
    + [RA] Remove tcl as a valid interpreter since tclx8.3 is obsolete.
      (tclsh is the standard interpreter name.)
    + [RA] Require versioned dependencies for OCaml scripts.  Each version
      is ABI-incompatible.  Thanks, Samuel Mimram.  (Closes: #462065)
    + [RA] Add tcl and tk metapackages.  Thanks, Sergei Golovan.
      (Closes: #463281)
    + [RA] Catch exec wrappers that use $* instead of $@ (not that this is
      a good idea).  Thanks, Adam D. Barratt.  (Closes: #463476)
    + [RA] Integrate several more bashism checks from checkbashisms in
      devscripts.  Patch from Adam D. Barratt.  (Closes: #464026)

  * checks/debian-readme{.desc,}:
    + Combine readme-debian-{is,contains}-debmake-template and be less

      and Live CD support.  Thanks, Daniel Baumann.  (Closes: #453931)

      ones elsewhere are too strange.  (Closes: #459252)
  * checks/menus{.desc,}:

      picky spelling and capitalization checks on the abstract and title
      fields.

    + [RA] Reformat long descriptions and collapse some tags.
    + [RA] For consistent results, only syntax-check sh and bash scripts.

    + [RA] Allow for HTML color tags.
    + [RA] Add -a to annotate an override file.

  * lib/Dep.pm:

      substvars as equivalent.  Thanks, Julien Cristau.  (Closes: #456802)
  * lib/Spelling.pm:
    + [RA] Stop doing capitalization checks on all files; there's too much
      of a risk of false positives.  Instead, provide a separate picky
      spelling check function for package descriptions and similar cases
      where we're more sure of the contents.
    + [RA] Expand the picky capitalization checks to catch Debian, GNOME,
      KDE, and Linux.  (Closes: #456582)

  * checks/menu-format{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Add Actions to the KDE-specific desktop file keys.  Add
      Application as an acceptable Main Category even though it's not
      listed in the standard; given how widely it's used, it doesn't
      appear to be worth warning about right now.  (Closes: #444651)
    + [RA] Add GNUstep as an acceptable Main Category, since it's used as
      a non-standard category by GNUstep applications.
    + [RA] Warn about desktop files containing CRLF line endings (and then
      strip the CR for later checks).  The standard is explicit that each
      line ends in only LF.

    + [RA] Wrap Depends for readability.

    + [RA] Ignore Original-Maintainer if the version contains ubuntu.
    + [RA] Only warn about Section for Python packages starting with

    + [RA] Remove mention of unused /usr/share/lintian/info directory.

  * lib/DebVersions.pm:
    + [RA] Remove.  This isn't used by anything and would produce

  * lib/Tags.pm:
    + [RA] Keep statistics on overrides by severity.

  * reporting/html_reports:

      each report will be in /reports/maintainer/<email>.html where
      <email> is the maintainer's e-mail address with unsafe characters
      replaced by _.  This should allow better links from the QA pages.

      Application (also fixed in the previous release).
    + [RA] Fix Perl flow error when skipping some desktop files.
    + [RA] Skip unknown and deprecated key warnings and encoding key
      warnings in desktop files if they were of an unknown type.

  * lib/Dep.pm:
    + [RA] Fix negative implication in some boundary cases when comparing
      two versioned relationships in the same direction.  Thanks to
      Raphael Hertzog for the analysis and fix.  (Closes: #446768)

lintian (1.23.35) unstable; urgency=low

  The "frantic bug catchup" release.

  * checks/changelog-file{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Add some basic checks for NEWS.Debian files: naming,
      compression, encoding, a syntax check with Parse::DebianChangelog,
      and unreleased for the distribution.  (Closes: #437707)
  * checks/common_data.pm:
    + [RA] Allow Homepage in source and binary packages.
  * checks/control-file:
    + [RA] Support and ignore comments in debian/control.  Thanks, Julien
      Cristau.  (Closes: #440830)
    + [RA] Check for XS-Vcs-* headers and recommend (at info level) that
      they be changed to Vcs-* headers.  (Closes: #444661)
  * checks/cruft.desc:
    + [RA] Fix incorrect tag name for patch failure files.  Thanks, Romain
      Francoise.  (Closes: #437463)
  * checks/debconf:
    + [RA] A cdebconf that supported error was released with sarge, so
      don't require a versioned cdebconf dependency.  Thanks, Thijs
      Kinkhorst.  (Closes: #438860)
    + [RA] Various improvements from Thomas Huriaux: Diagnose select
      templates with only yes/no options, diagnose more question prompts,
      warn on any questions in the extended description, allow yes/no
      mentions in non-boolean templates, and catch more first-person
      language.  (Closes: #439508)
    + [RA] More exactly follow the Developer's Reference recommendations
      by only requiring open prompts for string and password prompts and
      only complaining about imperative wording for select and multiselect
      templates.  Thanks, Steve Langasek.  (Closes: #442711)
  * checks/description{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Warn (at info level for now) about Homepage pseudo-fields in
      the extended description.  (Closes: #444336)
  * checks/fields:
    + [RA] Allow python-all as yet another way of satisfying a Python
      build dependency.  (Closes: #444642)
  * checks/fields.desc:
    + [RA] Properly escape < and >.
  * checks/files{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Warn about Thumbs.db files, which are usually useless Windows
      thumbnail databases.  Thanks, Paul Wise.  (Closes: #438202)
    + [RA] Warn about .DS_Store files, used by Mac OS X to store extended
      folder attributes.  Thanks, Paul Wise.  (Closes: #438203)
    + [RA] Improve the recommended command to remove .packlist files.
      Thanks, Justin Pryzby.
    + [RA] Don't think hard links are zero-length files.
    + [RA] Diagnose files with names ending in whitespace.
  * checks/infofiles:
    + [RA] Emacs 22 now allows embedded images in info files, so accept
      and ignore PNG files in the info directory.  More image types may be
      needed.  Thanks, Andreas Metzler.  (Closes: #438602)
  * checks/menu-format{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Reserved categories are okay in .desktop files if OnlyShowIn is
      present, and generally deserve their own separate tag regardless.
      Thanks, Michael Biebl.  (Closes: #442709)
    + [RA] Ignore categories beginning with "X-", reserved for category
      extensions.  Thanks, Josselin Mouette.  (Closes: #443827)
    + [RA] Allow Actions keys.  This isn't in the desktop standard but
      is widely used.  Thanks, Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #444651)
    + [RA] Ignore desktop files not for one of the known types.  This
      should significantly reduce the noise for KDE packages.
    + [RA] Only check whether a program referenced by Exec is in the
      package if the desktop file is in /usr/share/applications.  Too many
      applications use Exec for desktop files elsewhere without the
      standard PATH.
    + [RA] Ignore Exec fields pointing to kcmshell.
    + [RA] Ignore desktop files in /usr/share/doc or that appear to be
      templates.
    + [RA] Avoid uninitialized warnings on all-whitespace commands.
  * checks/menus:
    + [RA] Find the targets of hard links correctly.  (Closes: #444355)
    + [RA] Use the three-argument form of open to not fail on doc-base
      files ending in whitespace.  Error on doc-base files with Document
      fields that end in whitespace, since currently they break multiple
      tools.  Thanks, Ian Zimmerman.  (Closes: #444889)
  * checks/nmu.desc:
    + [RA] Remove obsolete note about binary NMUs.  Patch from Thijs
      Kinkhorst.  (Closes: #437925)
  * checks/scripts{.desc,}:
    + [RA] We now have a csh package.  Allow it as an alternative for csh
      script dependencies.  Thanks, Bernd Zeimetz.  (Closes: #440825)
    + [RA] Allow install-sgmlcatalog --remove in postinst as well as
      prerm and suggest removing it entirely in the long description.
  * checks/version-substvars.desc:
    + [RA] Properly escape < and >.

  * collection/changelog-file{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Collect NEWS.Debian as well as changelog.

lintian (1.23.33) unstable; urgency=low

  The "menu and cruft reorganization" release.

  * checks/common_data.pm:
    + [CW] Add automaken as a known virtual package.
    + [CW] Update architectures to dpkg 1.14.5, adding solaris-* and lpia.
    + [RA] Add %known_obsolete_emacs.
  * checks/cruft{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check for .git directories in source packages.  Thanks, Julien
      Cristau.  (Closes: #433516)
    + [RA] Substantially rewrite how all cruft checking against source
      packages is done, incorporating debdiff in the process.  There are
      now two tags for most source package cruft problems: one for files
      introduced in the Debian diff or in a native package, and one for
      files present upstream.  The former is at warning severity and the
      latter is at info severity, since it's usually not worth repackaging
      the upstream source to remove such files.  In the process,
      standardize the names of all of the tags and pull the regexes out
      into data instead of code for easier maintenance.  (Closes: #434744)
  * checks/debdiff{.desc}:
    + [RA] Removed, incorporated into checks/cruft.
  * checks/debian-readme:
    + [RA] Replace all uses of tag_error and tag_warn with just tag.
  * checks/fields{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Tag packages listing emacs21 as the preferred Emacs flavor in a
      dependency.  Thanks, Tatsuya Kinoshita.  (Closes: #434978)
    + [RA] Start tagging unversioned dependencies on coreutils again since
      the transition from fileutils is long-since finished.  Thanks,
      Guillem Jover.  (Closes: #436058)
  * checks/files{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check for .git directories in binary packages.
  * checks/menu-format{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Switch to the new menu hierarchy, which will be in the next
      release of Policy.  Add specific checks for the major renamings to
      hopefully cut down on the confusion and provide some specific
      guidance.  Remove the code that allowed for applications to create
      new sub-menus, since the current menu documentation says not to do
      that.  (Closes: #431844)
    + [RA] Add checks of desktop files.  The checks so far are basic, but
      do include key and category verification.  Based heavily on work by
      Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña.  (Closes: #277441, #433411)
  * checks/scripts{.desc,}:
    + [RA] If rm output is redirected to /dev/null, don't think that rm is
      removing /dev/null.  Thanks, Robert Luberda.  (Closes: #431259)
    + [RA] xjed also provides jed-script.  Thanks, Jörg Sommer.
      (Closes: #431629)
    + [RA] Don't complain about ruby libraries in /usr/lib/ruby that have
      shebang lines.  This is a common means for embedding unit tests in
      Ruby libraries.  Thanks, Paul van Tilburg.  (Closes: #431545)
    + [RA] Don't push depending directly on update-inetd in the long
      description of maintainer-script-needs-depends-on-update-inetd.
      Most packages should depend on inet-superserver.  Leave the check
      the same for the time being, however.
    + [RA] Replace all uses of tag_error and tag_warn with just tag.
  * checks/shared-libs:
    + [RA] Exclude udebs from dependency checking in the shlibs files
      since binary packages may legitimately declare udeb dependencies on
      other packages.  Thanks, Loïc Minier.  (Closes: #431395)
  * checks/spelling:
    + [RA] Replace all uses of tag_error and tag_warn with just tag.
  * checks/version-substvars:
    + [RA] Don't skip other checks for binNMUability when warning about
      the deprecated ${Source-Version} substvar.  Thanks, Lior Kaplan.
      (Closes: #432959)

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [RA] Add \w+-backports to the known distribution list.  Thanks,
      Vincent Danjean.  (Closes: #432268)

  * lib/Tags.pm:
    + [RA] Replace any newlines in the extra information to the tag
      function with \n.

  * man/lintian.1:
    + [RA] Remove the mention of the debdiff check script.

lintian (1.23.32) unstable; urgency=low

  The "stability of output" release.

  * checks/binaries:
    + [RA] Sort the package SONAMEs to provide more stable lintian tags.
      Patch from Cyril Brulebois.  (Closes: #428681)
  * checks/files{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Limit the Zope license exception to only .dtml, .pt, and .cpt
      files.  Thanks, Bernd Zeimetz.
    + [RA] Sort the files listed in package-contains-hardlink so that the
      lintian output is stable regardless of the hash order of the
      directory when the tar file was built.
    + [RA] Don't incorrectly skip all other file location checks for hard
      links.
    + [RA] Check for files installed in /usr/lib/sgml.  This transition
      was probably completed long ago, but checking for regression can't
      hurt.  (Closes: #90019)
  * checks/manpages{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check for dh_make man page templates (by looking for the
      template whatis entry).  Thanks, Bill Allombert.  (Closes: #173583)
  * checks/menus:
    + [RA] Avoid a quadratic search of the files in the package on
      doc-base files that list tons of files individually.  This speeds up
      a lintian check of openoffice.org-dev-doc enormously.
  * checks/po-debconf:
    + [RA] Close the template file handle between files so that the line
      numbers for translated default fields are correct.
  * checks/rules{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check for ignoring all errors from make clean or make distclean
      and recommend skipping the call if there's no Makefile instead.
      Thanks, Branden Robinson.  (Closes: #325372)
  * checks/scripts{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Add Octave as an interpreter, and allow both versioned and
      unversioned forms.  Thanks, Sebastian Harl.  (Closes: #428403)
    + [RA] Check for deprecated install-sgmlcatalog usage.
  * checks/shared_libs:
    + [RA] Report the correct file for shlib-with-nonpic-code rather than
      the last shlib in the package.  (Closes: #429840, #429528)

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [RA] Don't require -v in order to report unused overrides; they're
      already info-level tags, which is enough hiding.
    + [RA] Remove old dead unused override code.

  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [RA] Fix a Perl warning when generating the clean maintainer pages.

  * unpack/unpack-binpkg-l1:
    + [RA] Sort the output of tar tfv by filename so that the lintian
      output will be stable regardless of the hash order of the directory
      when the tar file was built.

  The "back under 100 open bugs" release.

  * checks/changelog-file:
    + [RA] Only check for missing colons in bug closers in the most recent
      changelog entry.  Thanks, Thijs Kinkhorst.  (Closes: #423171)
  * checks/common_data.pm:
    + [RA] Update architectures to dpkg 1.14.1.  Remove all linux-*
      architectures and add armel.  (Closes: #421995)
  * checks/control-files.desc:
    + [RA] Change unknown-control-file to a warning, since Policy only
      discourages it and doesn't outlaw it.  (Closes: #287209)
  * checks/cruft:
    + [RA] Allow any automake package to satisfy the autotools-dev build
      dependency for suppressing warnings about out of date autotools
      helper files.  (Closes: #417067)
  * checks/fields:
    + [RA] Require libmodule-build-perl in Build-Depends if the clean rule
      runs perl Build.  Hopefully this isn't too aggressive.  Thanks, Ian
      Beckwith.  (Closes: #421549)
  * checks/files:
    + [RA] Don't warn about LICENSE files in Zope products, since they may
      be used for runtime display.  (Closes: #424164)
  * checks/manpages:
    + [RA] Avoid false positives on binaries with X11 in the name.  Patch
      from Kevin B. McCarty.  (Closes: #423229)
  * checks/menu-format.desc:
    + [RA] Improve the pkg-not-in-package-test long description and add a
      manual reference.  (Closes: #423519)
  * checks/menus:
    + [RA] Allow multiple blank lines between doc-base sections and
      trailing blank lines in the file.  doc-base is fine with this.
      Reported by Luis Rodrigo Gallardo Cruz.  (Closes: #423096)
  * checks/scripts:
    + [RA] Add pagsh, provided by openafs-client and heimdal-clients.
    + [RA] Diagnose removal of device files in maintainer scripts per
      Policy 10.6.  (Closes: #268688)
    + [RA] Add jruby1.0.  Thanks, Sebastien Delafond.  (Closes: #426950)
    + [RA] Add jed and friends.  Thanks, Jörg Sommer.  (Closes: #426469)
    + [RA] Move several maintainer script checks specific to shell scripts
      inside the conditional so that they won't run on maintainer scripts
      not written in shell.
    + [RA] Diagnose maintainer scripts looking at /var/lib/dpkg/status
      directly.  Thanks, Guillem Jover.  (Closes: #426628)
    + [RA] Diagnose direct modifications to /etc/services, /etc/protocols,

      eight-year-old bug!)  (Closes: #32532)
  * checks/version-substvars{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Add a check for deprecated ${Source-Version} substvars.  Patch
      from Guillem Jover.  (Closes: #427577)

lintian (1.23.30) unstable; urgency=low

  The "beating false positives off with a stick" release.

  * checks/common_data.pm:
    + [RA] Add mktemp and sysvinit-utils as known essential packages.
    + [RA] Add Vcs-Mtn and Vcs-Browser to the known source package
      fields.
    + [RA] Add Kernel-Version to known udeb control fields.
  * checks/control-files:
    + [RA] Allow clilibs, but don't try to check the syntax of it yet.
      Thanks, Sebastian Dröge.  (Closes: #378088)
  * checks/copyright-file:
    + [RA] Exclude the Affero General Public License from the check for
      references to the shared GPL copy.  (Closes: #420077)
    + [RA] Replace yet another hand-rolled dependency parser with Dep.
  * checks/cruft{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check for svk commit message files.
  * checks/debconf{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Remove the dependency check for SETTITLE since all debconf
      implementations back to oldstable support it.
    + [RA] Reduce the dependency check for error templates to info since
      all debconf implementations back to stable support it.
  * checks/debhelper{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Downgrade the dependency check for dh_python and the Python
      policy to info since all debhelpers back to stable support it.
    + [RA] Downgrade the dependency check for compatibility level V5 to
      info since all debhelpers back to stable support it.
  * checks/fields{.desc,}:
    + [RA] The CDBS Python rules only call pycentral or pysupport during
      the binary targets, so those dependencies can be safely moved to
      Build-Depends-Indep.  Still allow them in Build-Depends, though,
      since that's where CDBS likes to put them.  Thanks, Tristan
      Seligmann.  (Closes: #420526)
    + [RA] Allow the Python core packages themselves to depend on
      python-minimal.
    + [RA] Remove the version constraints for python-central and
      python-support dependencies since stable released with a working
      version and they weren't in oldstable.
    + [RA] Remove the dependency check on dh_installxfonts for the X.Org
      transition since the debhelper released with stable does the right
      thing and this dependency is not useful for backports to oldstable.
    + [RA] Remove the version on the quilt dependency check.  It's not
      worth the effort to maintain a separate version check for oldstable
      backports.  (Closes: #420160)
  * checks/files{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check for svk commit message files.
    + [RA] Don't consider {copying,license}.dtd extra license files; the
      Mozilla suite uses them for non-licenses.  (Closes: #420558)
    + [RA] Use $pkg rather than reading fields/package for the x11-common
      pre-depend check.
    + [RA] Allow x11-common to install /usr/X11R6/bin.
    + [RA] Downgrade the pre-depends on x11-common requirement for
      packages installing into /usr/include/X11 or /usr/lib/X11 to info
      since it's only needed for upgrades from sarge or early etch.
  * checks/md5sums:
    + [RA] Don't warn about a missing md5sums file if the package contains
      nothing for which we would generate an MD5 checksum.  Thanks,
      Andreas Beckmann.  (Closes: #420465)
  * checks/manpages:
    + [RA] Cope with more uses of - in *roff escapes that don't need
      hyphen warnings.
    + [RA] Don't consider a binary an X binary if it's a symlink into
      /etc/X11.  (seyon does something weird but probably legitimate.)
    + [RA] Fix manpage-for-non-x11-binary-in-wrong-directory and
      manpage-for-x11-binary-in-wrong-directory output.  (Closes: #295072)
  * checks/menus{.desc,}:
    + [RA] In doc-base control files, check for Index fields for HTML and
      Info documents and require that each section after the header have a
      Format field.  Thanks, Bernhard R. Link.  (Closes: #419847)
  * checks/rules:
    + [RA] Listing a rule as a dependency of .PHONY is sufficient to mark
      it as present for GNU make and hence sufficient for Policy's
      requirement.  Thanks, Peter Eisentraut.  (Closes: #419446)
  * checks/scripts{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Packages calling update-xmlcatalog must depend on xml-core.
      Also avoid false positives when a package itself provides the
      program its maintainer scripts use.  Thanks, Daniel Leidert.
      (Closes: #419461)
    + [RA] Check for maintainer scripts calling read (but exclude those
      that include /usr/share/debconf/confmodule on the grounds that
      they're probably only using it as a fallback).  Based on a patch by
      Luk Claes.  (Closes: #231770)
    + [RA] Add pike7.6 and ruby1.9 as valid interpreters.
    + [RA] Diagnose use of /bin/env with a more specific message than the
      generic unusual interpreter tag.
    + [RA] Remove the version constraint on the gconf-schemas check since
      all versions of gconf2 back to stable provide this script and it's
      not worth maintaining a separate check for oldstable backports.
  * checks/shared-libs{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Warn if a package declares dependencies in its shlibs control
      file that cannot be satisfied by that package (including via
      Provides).  (Closes: #56440)

  * reporting/harness:
    + [RA] Include overridden tags in the lintian output so that we can do
      statistical reporting on them and see them in lintian.log.
  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [RA] Create stub pages for maintainers with only lintian-clean
      packages.  (Closes: #305173)
    + [RA] Sort packages on each maintainer's page.
    + [RA] Report statistics on info tags as well.
    + [RA] Generate better file names for maintainer pages with weird
      characters.
    + [RA] Fix Perl warnings.

  * checks/cruft{.desc,}:

    + [RA] Allow a build dependency on automake to satisfy the
      autotools-dev requirement since users may use autoreconf to update
      config.{sub,guess}.  Thanks, Jordà Polo.  (Closes: #417067)
  * checks/debconf:
    + [RA] Rather than munging dependencies to cope with the various
      implementations of debconf, take advantage of our new dependency
      comparison routines and check the full correct dependency.  This
      should really fix problems with checking the dependencies for
      settitle.  Patch from Damyan Ivanov.  (Closes: #349616)
    + [RA] Check that an appropriate versioned dependency on debconf
      and/or cdebconf is present if error template types are used.
      Thanks, Christian Perrier.  (Closes: #416140)
  * checks/debhelper.desc:
    + [RA] Use consistent file naming when diagnosing possibly conflicting
      debhelper compat settings.  Thanks, Jari Aalto.  (Closes: #409122)
  * checks/fields{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Add an exception to maintainer-not-full-name for Wookey and a
      comment to consider removing the check if we get more false
      positives.  Thanks, Neil Williams.  (Closes: #406731)
    + [RA] Rename build-depends-indep-should-be-build-depends to
      clean-should-be-satisfied-by-build-depends to make the reason for
      the message clearer without running lintian -i.  Thanks to Osamu
      Aoki for the suggestion.  (Closes: #405840)
    + [RA] Recognize the +bX convention for binary NMUs.  Warn about use
      of the old three-part version numbers.
  * checks/files{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Diagnose creation of subdirectories of /usr/bin other than mh
      and the legacy X11 directory.  (Closes: #417912)
  * checks/manpages:
    + [RA] When checking for hyphen used as a minus sign, avoid false
      positives on \s-1 (small font) and \*(-- (pod2man long dash).
    + [RA] Display the full path for binary-without-manpage tags to make
      it easier to track down problems.
    + [RA] Ignore binaries in subdirectories of the normal binary
      directories (other than /usr/bin/X11 and /usr/bin/mh).  These should
      be caught by other checks and the man page warnings would likely be
      confusing noise.
  * checks/menu-format{.desc,}:
    + [RA] If a menu icon isn't an absolute path, only look for it in
      /usr/share/pixmaps, not in the old X11R6 paths.  Update the long tag
      description accordingly.
  * checks/menus:
    + [JA] Perl syntax corrections.  Removed extra empty newlines.
  * checks/lintian.desc:

      Reported by Jari Aalto.  (Closes: #409108)
    + [RA] Recognize the +bX convention for binary NMUs.
  * checks/po-debconf:
    + [RA] Now that we're passing --use-untranslated to msgcmp, we have to
      compare the generated pot file with the one in the package both
      directions to catch all out of date errors.  Thanks, Thomas
      Huriaux.  (Closes: #402662)
  * checks/rules{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Fix the policy section for debian-rules-missing-required-target
      and debian-rules-not-a-makefile.  Thanks, Daniel Kahn Gillmor.
      (Closes: #414964)
    + [RA] Warn about use of $(PWD) instead of $(CURDIR).
    + [RA] Setting DH_COMPAT globally in debian/rules is now deprecated in
      favor of debian/compat.  Patch from Luk Claes.  (Closes: #330025)
  * checks/scripts{.desc,}:
    + [RA] update-inetd is now its own package and netbase may not always
      depend on it.  Update the check to require a dependency on
      update-inetd, inet-superserver, or one of the inet-superserver
      packages that provides update-inetd.  Reported by Tatsuya Kinoshita.
      (Closes: #402319)
    + [RA] Mention SUSv3 in the bashism and non-posix tag descriptions,
      note that use of test -a/-o and local aren't bugs but may still be
      worth avoiding, and mention short circuiting of && and ||.  (Thanks
      to Jari Aalto for the latter).
    + [RA] Add /usr/bin/gbr2, provided by gambas2-runtime.  Thanks, José
      "L. Redrejo" Rodríguez.  (Closes: #403515)
    + [RA] Add /usr/bin/jruby0.9, provided by jruby0.9.  Thanks, Sebastien

  The "we haven't run this against the whole archive in a while" release

  * checks/binaries{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Tag unrecognized ELF binaries as apparently corrupted rather
      than failing with a note that binutils-multiarch is required.  Some
      packages have had ELF binaries recognized by file but unreadable.
      Reported by Bill Allombert.  (Closes: #399456)
  * checks/infofiles:
    + [RA] Don't consider /usr/share/infon to be an info directory.
      Reported by Joachim Breitner.  (Closes: #399857)
  * checks/md5sums:
    + [RA] Also don't complain about missing md5sums for files in
      /var/lib/ispell as they're changed after installation.  Thanks,
      Agustin Martin.  (Closes: #401070)
  * checks/po-debconf:
    + [RA] gettext 0.16's msgcmp requires --use-untranslated when checking
      for newer templates than PO files or it gives false positives for
      every package.  Thanks, Damyan Ivanov.  (Closes: #400957)
    + [RA] Don't consider directories to be stray template files even if
      named template.  Thanks, Thomas Huriaux.  (Closes: #401442)
  * checks/shared-libs:
    + [RA] Don't report shlib-with-non-pic-code unless we're sure that
      we're looking at a shared library.  Otherwise, we get many false
      positives on some platforms where text relocations are normal for
      binaries.  Reported by Bill Allombert.  (Closes: #399525)

  * collection/file-info:
    + [RA] Unescape non-ASCII characters escaped by tar before running
      file on the resulting filename.  Otherwise, file can't find the
      file, exits with an error, and lintian aborts.  Reported by Bill
      Allombert.  (Closes: #399392)
  * collection/objdump-info:
    + [RA] Include unrecognized format errors from objdump in the output
      rather than aborting; some packages contain apparently corrupt ELF
      binaries.

  * debian/control:
    + [RA] Depend on gettext 0.16 or later for --use-untranslated.

  * lib/Lab.pm:
    + [RA] Preserve the old package lists when setting up a static lab so
      that the unpack programs can build a list of changed packages and
      incremental mode works.  Thanks, Bill Allmobert.  (Closes: #400342)

    + [RA] Add a policy reference for unstripped-binary-or-object.
      Thanks, Bas Wijnen.  (Closes: #394419)
    + [RA] Add a special exception to the shared library dependency check
      for the dynamic loader itself.
  * checks/changelog-file.desc:
    + [RA] Downgrade to a warning several errors with changelog files,
      including compression and a text version of HTML changelogs, that
      are only shoulds in Policy.  (Closes: #289723)
    + [RA] Cleaned up language and use of unbalanced single quotes in
      numerous descriptions.
  * checks/control-file{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Diagnose a control file that creates binary packages in a
      different archive category from the source package or the other
      binary packages.  Idea from Yann Dirson.  (Closes: #394720)
    + [RA] Close opened files.
    + [RA] Add info-level check for Section in the source section of the
      control file.  (Closes: #322244)
  * checks/cruft{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Tighten the timestamp check on config.{sub,guess} to look for
      files dated 2004 or newer, since that's when x86_64 was added.
      Increase to an error at the request of Ryan Murray since we already
      suppress this warning of config.{guess,sub} are modified by the
      Debian patch or if the package build-depends on autotools-dev.
      (Closes: #190897)
  * checks/debconf{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Take into account comma escaping when checking the number of
      translated choices.  Reported by Frans Pop.  (Closes: #395028)
    + [RA] Only require debconf be loaded in the postinst script if a
      config script exists.  Reported by Josselin Mouette.
    + [RA] Require pre-depends on debconf if debconf is used in the
      preinst script.  Update the long description to deprecate only
      depending on debconf and falling back on another configuration
      system.  Reported by Josselin Mouette.  (Closes: #395468)
    + [RA] Warn of debconf notes displayed with low or medium priority,
      with an exception for Policy-required device file warnings.  Based
      on a patch by Thomas Huriaux.  (Closes: #389070)
    + [RA] Close files after opening them, fixing incorrect line numbers
      when reporting problems with config scripts.
  * checks/debdiff{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check for creation of ~ and .xxx.swp backup files in the Debian
      diff, but only at the info level for now since they cause no harm.
      (Closes: #332770)
  * checks/fields{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Clarify in missing-build-dependency why lintian does not take
      into account transitive build dependencies.  (Closes: #393975)
    + [RA] Avoid Perl warning when diagnosing a Python-Version of the form
      "all, >= 2.4".  Thanks, Thijs Kinkhorst.  (Closes: #394104)
    + [RA] Teach the debian/rules parsing about make conditionals and
      don't require build dependencies for lines encountered inside a
      conditional (in other words, assume people using conditionals know
      what they're doing).  Fixes a false positive due to the unusual
      arch-specific build dependencies for openoffice.org, reported by
      Rene Engelhard.  (Closes: #380286)
  * checks/files{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check for vim .swp files in the package.
    + [RA] Split the warning for NFS temporary files into a separate tag
      from the warning for editor backup files.
  * checks/infofiles:
    + [RA] Close opened files.
    + [RA] debhelper no longer adds a --section flag to install-info, so
      don't warn about any install-info invocation without --section.
      Instead, check each info file for INFO-DIR-SECTION and diagnose
      calling install-info without --section if any info file is missing
      this information.  (Closes: #97502, #398670)
    + [RA] Checks for the compression and suffixes of info files were not
      being run due to a mistake in specifying either /usr/info or
      /usr/share/info as an info directory.  Re-enable them.
  * checks/md5sums{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Add a tag for a missing md5sums control file, but only at info
      level, at least for now.  (Closes: #133027)
    + [RA] Do better syntax checking of the md5sums control file and
      report malformed lines as a tag rather than aborting lintian.
    + [RA] Downgrade file-missing-in-md5sums to a warning since it doesn't
      break the package or debsums and may be intentional.
  * checks/menu.desc:
    + [RA] Remove stray commas in Ref strings since the reporting code
      considers commas to be separating two different references.
  * checks/menu-format{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Support the sux, gksu, and kdesu wrappers in menu commands as
      well as su-to-root.  (Closes: #360227)
    + [RA] Fix tag name for menu-icon-cannot-be-parsed.  Thanks, Bill
      Allombert.  (Closes: #399245)
  * checks/po-debconf{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check for misnamed PO files in debian/po, which cause
      translations to be merged into the template with the wrong names and
      not found.  Based on a patch by Thomas Huriaux.  (Closes: #387360)
  * checks/shared-libs:

  * checks/debconf:
    + [CW] Don't trigger partially-translated-question when Choices-C exists
      but not Description-C.
    + [RA] Remove select-with-translated-default-field since there are
      cases where this is correct and we can perform a better check
      against the source package.  Patch from Thomas Huriaux.
    + [RA] Fix Perl warnings when a template has no type.
  * checks/debdiff:
    + [RA] Remove the source-tar-is-posix-tar tag.  This was only a
      problem for woody and earlier, and woody support is no longer
      needed.  Reported by Loïc Minier.  (Closes: #385833)
  * checks/fields{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Improve the long descriptions of the warnings about dependencies
      on essential or build-essential packages to make it clearer that the
      correct resolution is normally to omit the dependency and why.
    + [RA] Add a check for duplicate build dependencies.  (Closes: #359178)

    + [RA] Improve the no-description-in-changes-file information.
  * checks/md5sums:
    + [RA] aspell dictionary packages may ship files in /var/lib/aspell

      backwards.  Reported by Hamish Moffatt.  (Closes: #387845)

      isn't currently used in lintian.)
    + [RA] Add an unparse function to take an internal representation and
      convert it back to human-readable text.
    + [RA] Significantly improve and rewrite the get_dups function to only
      find relations that imply each other and to return the complete

      for program" (usually generated by help2man).
  * checks/menu:
    + [RA] Ignore trailing whitespace in doc-base files.  Patch from Bas
      Zoetekouw.  (Closes: #379749)
  * checks/nmu{.desc,}:
    + [RA] When checking for an NMU changelog entry, require "NMU" be
      surrounded by word boundaries.
    + [RA] Warn if the changelog incorrectly indicates an NMU.  Thanks to
      George Danchev for the report.
  * checks/scripts{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Except mkstemp from possibly-insecure-handling-of-tmp-files for
      maintainer scripts written in Perl.
    + [RA] Mention [[ ]] explicitly in the possible-bashism long
      description as requiring a Korn shell and make it clearer that the
      primary arbiter of this test is the POSIX shell specification.
      (Closes: #381800 by clarification)
    + [RA] Use the Dep library to check dependencies.  Add php5 to the
      interpreter list and correctly handle the dependencies for
      version-less PHP scripts.  (Closes: #379558)
    + [RA] Check for proper dependencies if gconf-schemas is called in
      maintainer scripts and diagnose calling gconftool(-2) directly.
      Thanks, Josselin Mouette.  (Closes: #333311)
  * checks/version-substvars{.desc,}:
    + [RA] New check from Adeodato Simó for proper use of substvars for
      versioned dependencies between packages built from the same source
      package so that NMUs will work properly.  Also catch use of such a
      substvar for a versioned dependency on a package not built from the
      same source.  (Closes: #377141, #376596)

  * collection/changelog-file:
    + [RA] Be much more careful about changelog files that are symlinks.
      Don't skip over changelog symlinks just because they point to
      non-existent files, mark unsafe symlinks or symlinks to non-existent
      files by creating copyright as a symlink to a non-existent file in
      the lab, and don't create an empty dummy changelog if we couldn't
      find a changelog.  Correctly handle changelog files that are
      symlinks to other files in the same directory.

  * debian/copyright:
    + [RA] Add Subversion repository location.

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [JvW] Give error if there is no "Description" field in .changes, this is
      required by dak

  * frontend/lintian-info:
    + [RA] Add the -t or --tags option that, given a tag name, prints out
      the description.  (Closes: #376109)

  * lib/Tags.pm:
    + [RA] If a tag has been overridden via any mechanism, do not add it to
      any of the statistics (tag, severity, or significance).  Before, the
      override only suppressed a record for the specific statistic the
      override was based on, meaning that classic tag-based overrides
      didn't suppress severity statistics.  Overridden error tags would
      therefore cause lintian to exit with non-zero status.  Thanks,
      Andree Leidenfrost and Martin F. Krafft.  (Closes: #377182, #374314)

  * man/lintian.1:
    + [RA] Better document the --archivedir and --dist options and how
      lintian constructs the path to an archive.  (Closes: #383203)
    + [RA] Document new version-substvars check script.
  * man/lintian-info.1:
    + [RA] Document the new -t or --tags option.

  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [RA] Include the lintian version in HTML page footers.  Thanks,
      Thijs Kinkhorst.  (Closes: #377616)

      question type. (Closes: #374399)
    + [RA] Exclude debconf templates with "for internal use" in the short

      templates.  (Closes: #368206)
  * checks/common_data.pm:

  * checks/debhelper:
    + [RA] Use the Dep library to check debhelper build dependencies
      rather than parsing Build-Depends with regexes.  This avoids false
      positives due to matching package names ending in debhelper.
      Reported by Fabio Tranchitella.  (Closes: #366531)
  * checks/fields:
    + [RA] Allow build-depend on quilt if clean depends on the xsfclean
      rule, for packages maintained by the X Strike Force.
    + [RA] CDBS packages that use the python-distutils class should list
      Python in Build-Depends, not Build-Depends-Indep, since CDBS wants
      to use it in debian/rules clean.  Thanks, Jan Lübbe.
    + [HE] Add check for build-deps on build-essential. Yes, people do that.
    + [RA] Recognize direct invocations of quilt in clean rules and allow
      Build-Depends on quilt in that case.  Reported by Sam Hocevar.
      (Closes: #374878)
    + [RA] Fix handling of versioned Build-Depends to avoid spurious
      build-depends-without-arch-dep warnings.  Reported by Marcus
      Better.
    + [RA] Don't require Build-Depends on perl even if run explicitly in
      debian/rules clean, since perl-base may be sufficient.  Catch more
      ways perl could be run, including the common idiom for packages that
      use Build.PL.
    + [RA] Downgrade build-depends-without-arch-dep to info from warning.
      Policy doesn't require using Build-Depends-Indep for
      arch-independent packages and the test has a lot of false positives.
    + [RA] Require ant in Build-Depends when using the CDBS ant rule.
    + [RA] Bypass the build-depends-without-arch-dep check entirely when
      using ant, since determining which Java dependencies are then
      permissible in Build-Depends is too complex to do a proper job.
      Reported by Peter Eisentraut.  (Closes: #372190)
    + [RA] Only allow patch in Build-Depends for yada unpatch, don't
      require it, since yada depends on patch.  (Closes: #375479)

      Steve Langasek for the analysis.
    + [RA] Allow a build-dependency on patchutils when using CDBS with one
      of the patch systems, as patchutils may be optionally used to check
      for bad patches.  Thanks, Marc Dequènes (Duck).  (Closes: #365466)
    + [RA] Since some packages should be in Build-Depends and some should
      be in Build-Depends-Indep, report all of the misplaced ones rather
      than just the first one.  That way, users know which to move.
    + [RA] Allow perl in Build-Depends if invoked in clean rules.
    + [RA] Allow patch in Build-Depends if yada unpatch is invoked in
      clean rules.
  * checks/files{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Add an explicit check for non-world-readable executables to
      provide a more detailed explanation and tighten the accepted
      permissions of setuid and setgid executables to just the permissions
      mentioned in Policy 10.9.  Add Policy 10.9 references to the
      descriptions.  Reported by Piotr Engelking.  (Closes: #365452)
    + [RA] Add a request to the descriptions of setuid and setgid tags to
      add a lintian override for documentation if the permissions are
      intentional.
    + [RA] Report a more specific tag for binaries that are owned by group
      games but are not setgid.
    + [RA] Remove the check for files in /usr/lib/cgi-bin.  This policy
      change was reverted.
    + [RA] Allow files installed in /usr/include/X11 and /usr/lib/X11 but
      require Pre-Depends on x11-common (>= 1:7.0.0).  Remove the
      duplicate check for files in /usr/bin/X11 since it no longer adds
      additional information.
  * checks/menus{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check that all files referenced in doc-base control files are
      present in the package, based on a patch by Robert Luberda.  Also
      check that Index references only one file and that Format names a
      known format.  (Closes: #196122)
    + [RA] Fix incomplete diagnosis of missing calls to update-menus.
    + [RA] Change postrm to prerm in the check for a useless install-docs
      call; calling install-docs in postrm is always a warning and useless
      calls in prerm were not being diagnosed.
  * checks/po-debconf{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Exempt packages that use yada from the POTFILES.in check and
      from checking for up-to-date templates, since yada does this at
      build time.  Reported by Piotr Roszatycki.  (Closes: #321139)

      Dequènes (Duck).  (Closes: #365041)
  * checks/files{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Add the references to Policy for the deprecation of X11R6

  * checks/scripts:
    + [RA] Debian etch release policy explicitly forbids scripts without

  The "brown paper Python" release

  * checks/fields{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Redo handling of build dependencies to allow a custom tag to be

      rather than a simple package name.  As a result, dh_python handling
      is no longer a buggy special case.  Allow either python or

    + [RA] Only list examples of non-standard architectures, since there
      are now too many combinations to list completely.
    + [RA] Catch dependencies on X metapackages, based on a patch by Josh
      Triplett.  No packages are allowed to build-depend, and only
      packages that look like metapackages (arch: all, no files outside of
      /usr/share/doc) are allowed to depend.  (Closes: #347169)

    + [RA] Reorganize dependency checking based on debian/rules analysis.
      Diagnose missing build dependencies on the helper packages we know
      about, catch cases where Build-Depends-Indep should be Build-Depends
      because of the clean target, and make sure users of dh_python
      build-depend on python.  yada is no longer a special case.

      binaries installed in /usr/X11R6.  Rename the existing check for
      other files in /usr/X11R6 since the tag had a pluralization error
      and we want package maintainers to see the error again and
      reconsider whether to ignore it.  No packages should be installing
      files in /usr/X11R6 going forward.  Remove the policy cross-refs for

  * checks/manpages:
    + [RA] Use system_env instead of system and sanitize the environment

      when CDPATH is set.  Reported by Marc Haber.  (Closes: #360217)
  * checks/nmu{.desc,}:

      positive.  Reported by Frank Küster.  (Closes: #344998)
    + [RA] Make the syntax checking of shell scripts more robust against
      filenames containing shell metacharacters.  Reported by Michael
      Stilkerich.
    + [RA] Add fish and expectk to the list of valid interpreters.
      (Closes: #351624, #353770)
    + [RA] /usr/bin/tcl is provided by tclx8.3, not tcl.  Reported by
      James R. Van Zandt.  (Closes: #351324)
    + [RA] Allow more variations on leading magic to invoke some
      interpreter rather than then shell.  Bypass the ELF magic check for
      scripts using magic that relies on having no leading #! line.
      Reported by Frank Küster.  (Closes: #344269)
    + [JvW] Add check against package suffering from debhelper bug #337664,
      per Joey Hess, which had broken error detection (Closes: #358523)
  * checks/shared-libs:
    + [JvW] Fix postinst-must-call-ldconfig to also get emitted when there is
      no postinst at all, instead of just one lacking a ldconfig call
    + [JvW] Implement checks for "udeb:" lines in shlibs files
      (Closes: #357541)
    + [JvW] Consider also the soname version for shlibs checking, preventing
      some bogus 'duplicate' warnings, and actually throw a warning when
      soname version doesn't match
    + [JvW] Added error when udeb postinst calls ldconfig, that must never
      happen (thanks to Frans Pop for noticing, see #203056)

  * debian/{control,copyright}:
    + [RA] Add Russ Allbery to Uploaders and copyright.
    + [JvW] Version dpkg-dev requirement to >= 1.13.17, for
      unpack/unpack-srcpkg-l2

  * frontends/lintian-info:
    + [RA] Avoid Perl uninitialized value warnings when given output that
      looks like lintian messages without tags.  (Closes: #352606)

  * collection/objdump-info:
    + [RA] Pass "Invalid operation" errors from objdump -T on to the check
      scripts instead of failing.  (Closes: #249435)

  * man/lintian.1:
    + [RA] Add references to dh_make, debhelper, dpkg-buildpackage, and
      linda in new reference sections.  (Closes: #322288)
  * man/{lintian.1,lintian-info.1}:
    + [RA] Left-justify and disable hyphenation for readability.

  * unpack/unpack-srcpkg-l2:
    + [JvW] Use -q with dpkg-source to suppress warnings about unsigned source
      packages. Requires dpkg-dev 1.13.17

  * checks/debhelper:
    + [FL] Also check for debhelper build-dependency in debhelper-using
      cdbs based packages
    + [FL] Indicate where we found which compat version in
      declares-possibly-conflicting-debhelper-compat-versions
      (Closes: #329953)
    + [FL] Add dh_installtexfonts to list of commands that modify
      the maintainer scripts
    + [FL] Try a little harder to find the DH_COMPAT setting in debian/rules
      (Closes: #348380)
  * checks/fields:
    + [FL] Allow version numbers of 0 by correctly checking the output
      of _valid_version for definedness and not the boolean value
      (Closes: #345005)
    + [FL] Better check for false positives of build-depends-without-arch-dep.
      Should fix false positives for cdbs, dbs, dpatch and yada. Based on
      a patch by Russ Allbery (Closes: #344609, #321135, #339750)
    + [FL] Also check for build-dependencies on obsolete packages not
      only dependencies (Closes: #234531)
  * checks/fields.desc:
    + [JvW] Fix typo in description
  * checks/init.d:
    + [FL] Only try to validate update-rc.d calls where the name of the
      script matches [\w.-]+. That accounts for all today known init
      scripts and eliminates false positives like shell variables in the
      name (Closes: #343865)
  * checks/manpages:
    + [FL] Fix stupid mistake in regex to strip of filenames from roff
      output (which was hidden by another stupid mistake in the test
      suite). Patch by Nicolas François (Closes: #347999)
  * checks/scripts:
    + [FL] Make mknod-in-maintainer-script an error since this is now
      a must in policy. Pointed out by Bartosz Fenski (Closes: #344928)
    + [FL] dpkg --print-installation-architecture is deprecated
      so delete dpkg-print-architecture-in-maintainer-script

  * frontend/lintian:

      if we found any error. (Closes: #329458)
    + [FL] Re-enable reporting unused overrides.

  * lib/Tags.pm:
    + [FL] Some fixes to the statistics code to make the fixes
      in frontend/lintian possible

  * checks/binaries{.desc,}:
    + [FL] support c2a suffix in soname check, too (Closes: #340856)
    + [FL] fix typo in description of package-name-doesnt-match-sonames
      (Closes: #339360)
    + [FL] The Debian specific patches from coreutils to call strip with
      --remove-section arguments on install -s have been dropped. Adapt
      description of binary-has-unneeded-section accordingly and demote
      it to "info" because many packages will get this now.
  * checks/debconf{.desc,}:
    + [FL] drop seen-flag-requires-versioned-depends and
      multiselect-without-dependency and drop version requirement from
      missing-debconf-dependency-for-preinst. All due to the fact that
      woody shipped with 1.0.x and therefor versioned depends on versions
      lesser than that don't make much sense anymore (Closes: #333736)
  * checks/debhelper:
    + [FL] debhelper compat level 3 is deprecated as well now (Closes: #340222)
  * checks/files:
    + [FL] forgot /lib(32|64) (more #328612 fixes)
  * checks/menu-format:
    + [FL] Drop su-to-root-with-usr-bin and su-to-root-without-usr-sbin,
      and add su-to-root-with-usr-sbin to adapt to current menu package
      and policy (Closes: #332400)
  * checks/po-debconf:
    + [FL] Fix logical error in search for files (Closes: #342707)
  * checks/scripts{.desc,}:
    + [FL] Drop install-fvwmgenmenu as valid interpreter. Was dropped
      from menu package before sarge. (also for #332400, see
      checks/menu-format)
    + [FL] Change path for install-menu from /usr/sbin to /usr/bin (also
      for #332400)
    + [FL] Merge most of the wrong-path-for-* and *-script-but-no-*-dep
      tags to two tags wrong-path-for-interpreter and
      missing-dep-for-interpreter. This makes maintaining the list of
      valid interpreters way easier. Some tags with special text have
      been special cased (php\d? and (m|g)awk).
    + [FL] Add speedy and slsh to list of valid interpreters
      (Closes: #333955, #336700)
  * checks/shared-libs:
    + [FL] forgot /lib(32|64) (hopefully finally closes: #328612)

  * The "doesn't contain all the fixes I would like but that's no

      (Closes: #327859)

  * checks/copyright-file:
    + [JvW] Demote FSF address check to warning
  * checks/description:
    + [HE] Change description-synopsis-is-duplicated to only be emitted if
      the synopsis is copied without being extended. (Closes: #316523)
  * checks/files:
    + [FL] Add some formats to the exception list for extra-license-file
      (jpe?g, gif and svg) (Closes: #324944)
    + [FL] Don't complain about lib(32|64) as unusual directories. Noted
      by Matthias Klose (partly fixes #328612, see checks/shared-libs for
      the rest)
  * checks/infofiles:
    + [FL] Don't issue install-info-not-called-with-section-option if
      the call in postinst is really a removal. Experienced by Ben Pfaff
      in autoconf (Closes: #329170)
  * checks/po-debconf:
    + [FL] Previously we only run the checks if we found a templates file
      and a debconf dependency. Since the latter is mostly generated by
      ${misc:Depends} nowadays, we now also run the checks if we find
      a templates and a config file. (Closes: #331672)
  * checks/scripts:
    + [FL] PythonX.Y dependency can also be satisfied with pythonX.Y-minimal.
      Noted by Matthias Klose (Closes: #326643)
    + [FL] Only match 'local' at the beginning of a line. The check is too
      ambiguous otherwise. Reported by Marc Haber (Closes: #330548)
    + [FL] Better reflect the current discussions whether some of the
      XSI:sms should be allowed in shell scripts by moving some of
      them to a separate check possible-non-posix-code-in-maintainer-script.
      Not doing that for kill -NAME as requested since -s NAME is available
      and should be perfectly portable. (Closes: #323053)
  * checks/shared-libs:
    + [HE] Apply patch from Bastian Blank to check for executable stacks in
      binaries. New checks are called shlib-without-PT_GNU_STACK-section,
      shlib-with-executable-stack, thanks waldi. (Closes: #321750)

      this bug? (Closes: #324673)

  * checks/binaries:

      the soname checks. This avoids many false positives. Patch by
      Russ Allbery (Closes: #321564)
    + [FL] Convert the SONAME to lower case before comparing with
      package name. Suggested by Josh Triplett (Closes: #321206, #325225)
    + [FL] Try to remove strings added for transition purposes from
      library package names before comparing package name with SONAME.
      Pointed out by Rene Engelhard (Closes: #322241, #324121)
    + [FL] Also remove -udeb strings and substitute lib64 with lib in
      package name before comparing with SONAME
    + [FL] Replace any occurrence of _ in the SONAME with - since the
      former isn't allowed in package names but occasionally used in
      sonames
    + [FL] Remove trailing .so from SONAMEs
    + [FL] Also ignore static binaries in sub directories of /boot,
      not only in /boot itself. Patch by Guillem Jover
      (Closes: #320382)
  * checks/changelog-file:
    + [FL] Detect old FSF address additionally to the even older
      one

  * checks/debhelper{,.desc}:
    + [FL] Warn about using debhelper compat version lower than 3
      like debhelper itself
    + [FL] Drop package-lacks-versioned-build-depends-on-debhelper
      tag for compat versions < 5. With debhelper 4 even in oldstable
      issuing an error here is silly
    + [FL] Fix typo (s,debian/control,debian/compat,) in description of
      declares-possibly-conflicting-debhelper-compat-versions
  * checks/description{,.desc}:
    + [FL] Avoid double warning about description-is-dh_make-template
      in the same way we do it for the corresponding debmake tag
    + [FL] Policy section of Description field has changed
  * checks/fields{,.desc}:
    + [FL] Fix a lot of off-by-one errors in the policy references
      (caused by the addition of the Uploaders field). Unknowingly

      >= 0.6 since prior versions have bugs regarding parse
      error handling

  * checks/binaries:

      (Closes: #305575, #313118)
  * checks/changelog-file{,.desc}:
    + [FL] Use libparse-debianchangelog-perl to parse the changelog,
      which detects a lot of syntax errors
    + [FL] Add a new tag debian-changelog-file-missing-or-wrong-name
      which is issued if we found no Debian changelog but an upstream
      changelog since the further checks will treat the
      latter file as the Debian changelog and only issuing
      debian-changelog-file-missing would be confusing then
      (Closes: #285152)
    + [FL] Detect closes: statements with non-valid bugnumbers,

  * checks/common_data.pm:

  * checks/control-file:

  * checks/po-debconf:
    + [FL] Abort check if the package doesn't seem to use debconf to
      avoid false positives in case maintainers use debian/po for
      other Debian specific strings (Closes: #262749)
  * checks/scripts:
    + [FL] increase search limit for exec hack by not counting comments
      and empty lines (Closes: #294661)
    + [FL] detect more bashisms, suggested by Clint Adams and
      martin f krafft (Closes: #253498, #296233 and addresses #253012

      a binary NMU. New check's name is binary-nmu-debian-revision-in-source.
      (Closes: #244830)
    + [HE] Warn if people use the Bugs field to refer to the Debian BTS, the
      new check is called redundant-bugs-field. (Closes: #245883)
  * checks/files:
    + [HE] Check that .desktop files are placed in /usr/share/applications.
      This seems to be the standard place for those files that are used
      to create menus. The check is called desktop-file-in-wrong-dir.
      (Closes: #200171)
  * checks/manpages:
    + [HE] Don't compare the manpage filename extension and the content of
      .TH case-sensitive. Report + patch by Jay Berkenbilt <ejb@ql.org>,
      thanks. (Closes: #285335)
    + [HE] Emit binary-without-english-manpage if a package only provides
      translated manpages for a binary. (Closes: #259227)
    + [HE] Skip all comment lines when checking for .so links in manpages.
      Thanks for the report and fix suggestion to Steinar H. Gunderson
      <sgunderson@bigfoot.com>. (Closes: #284662)
  * checks/md5sums:
    + [HE] Strip off ./ at the beginning of the filenames in md5sums
      files (this seems to happen on some systems, though we don't know
      how). (Closes: #284728)
  * checks/standards-version:
    + [CW] By definition, udebs aren't required to conform to policy, so
      don't issue no-standards-version-field for them. (If they happen to
      have a Standards-Version field anyway, we still check that it's
      valid.)

  * lib/Lab.pm, frontend/lintian:
    SECURITY (CAN-2004-1000):
    + [FL] Overhaul lab directory handling. This also fixes the issue
      of removing a lab that never was created (Closes: #286681)

  The "A little pause from the sarge release work" release.

  * checks/changelog-file:
    + [FL] file has apparently changed its output format for

      (Closes: #276504)
  * checks/deb-format, unpack/unpack-binpkg-l1, unpack/unpack-binpkg-l2:
    + [CW] Fix binary package data member extraction to work with arbitrary
      compression algorithms instead of hardcoding data.tar.gz.
  * checks/debconf{,.desc}:
    + [FL] The SETTITLE command was introduced in debconf version
      1.3.22. Check the depends for that (Closes: #261890)

      a version number. Change the description of the tag to reflect that.
      (Closes: #257904)

  * frontend/lintian-info:
    + [FL] Overrides start with O:, not with 0:, d'oh!
      (Closes: #258815)

lintian (1.23.3) unstable; urgency=low

  The ``the others must be busy releasing Sarge or something'' release,
  prepared by yours truly

  * checks/conffiles.desc:
    + Note the most likely cause for duplicate-conffile in the description
      (thanks Chris Anderson for running into this problem and asking me
      about it)
  * checks/copyright-file:
    + Revert the extra pedantic check introduced in 1.23.0 that
      complained about unstrict dependencies when one as a
      /usr/share/doc/<package> that is a symlink (Closes: #249414)
  * checks/debconf:
    + Don't warn when the Choices field of a debconf question is
      not translated, often it makes no sense to translate it
      (Closes: #262649)
  * checks/debhelper:
    + dh-make also creates sample files named .EX, so make that check
      case-insensitive (Closes: #251262)
  * checks/fields.desc:
    + Adjust package-has-a-duplicate-relation to warning, and note that
      this sometimes happens to you when using ${shlibs:Depends}, and you
      shouldn't bother too much if that's the case (Closes: #274286)
      Thanks Peter Eisentraut for the suggestion
    + Fix English language depends-on-essential-package-without-using-version,
      thanks to Peter Eisentrautf for noticing (Closes: #261603)
    + [FL] Clone depends-on-essential-package-without-using-version as
      build-depends-on-essential-package-without-using-version to give
      correct policy reference (Closes: #261602)
  * checks/init.d:
    + Don't warn for missing init.d scripts in package and conffile list
      if a variable is used instead of a real name (Closes: #264218)
  * checks/manpages.desc:
    + Demote binary-without-manpage to warning, and adjust description,
      to be consistent with policy, which says a manpage should be available
      (and doesn't use "must" for it). Thanks to Robert Millan for his patch
      (Closes: #271014)
  * checks/nmu.desc:
    + Note in source-nmu-has-incorrect-version-number's description that
      the mistake could also be the other way around (Closes: #258604)
  * checks/po-debconf:
    + Don't give missing-file-from-potfile-in on empty lines
      (Thanks Adam Conrad for noticing)

  * frontend/lintian:
    + Fix overrides so that they allow all of (1) <package> <type>:,
      (2) <package>:, and (3) <nothing> as prefix to tags you want to
      override, and modify documentation accordingly. This used to be buggy

lintian (1.23.1) unstable; urgency=low

  The ``Now featuring over 500 checks'' release, prepared by the usual
  suspects.

  * checks/*:
    + [JvW] Changed from executables to check-plugins
    + [HE] Drop the misuse of charset when we want to say "encoding".
      Renamed 2 tests for that:
      unknown-charset-in-po-file -> unknown-encoding-in-po-file
      debian-changelog-file-uses-obsolete-national-charset ->
      debian-changelog-file-uses-obsolete-national-encoding
      (Closes: #248194)
  * checks/binaries:
    + [FL] Change check for binary-compiled-with-profiling-enabled on
      hppa to look for _mcount instead of __gmon_start__ since the
      latter can't be used as an indicator on that arch (Closes: #207063)
    + [JvW] Exempt ocaml binaries from the 'is the binary stripped?' test,
      since they cannot be stripped harmlessly. See #256900 (Closes: #252695)
    + [JvW] Parse the output of file a little bit more strict, and make it
      consequent across checks (Closes: #257898)
  * checks/changelog-files{,.desc}:
    + [HE] New check latest-debian-changelog-entry-without-new-date, comparing
      the dates of the last 2 changelog entries. (Closes: #111215)
    + [FL] New tag invalid-date-in-changelog which is issued if
      latest-debian-changelog-entry-without-new-date encounters a
      parse error
  * checks/common-data.pm:
    + [JvW] Add libgl(u)-dev to list of virtual packages (Closes: #255595)
    + [JvW] Added amd64 to list of known architectures, as the name has
      settled and it'll likely enter the archive soonish (Closes: #257503)
  * checks/control-file{,.desc}:
    + [HE] Introduced new check script. New checks:
      - build-info-in-binary-control-file-section, triggered
        by a Build-* field in a binary section (Closes: #94928)
      - debian-control-file-uses-obsolete-national-encoding, stolen from
        changelog-file (Closes: #247197)
  * checks/cruft{,.desc}:
    + [JvW] cvsignore-file-in-source is now info, because it happens so often
      by upstream, and is only very minor in size
    + [HE] New check: source-contains-cvs-conflict-copy, triggered by
      .#file.version files. They are created by cvs when it tries to merge
      local changes and an update from the repo. (Closes: #246060)
    + [JvW] Also check for source-contains-svn-conflict-copy (for .r123 and
      .mine files)
  * checks/debhelper:
    + [FL] Avoid Perl warning about undefined values. Noted by JvW.
  * checks/fields{,.desc}:
    + [JvW] Added debian-revision-should-not-be-zero, suggested by Adam
      Conrad
    + [FL] Downgrade build-depends-without-arch-dep to warning as it's
      heuristic. Reword explanation. This partly handles #247171.
    + [JvW] For build-depends-without-arch-dep, fix detection of debhelper
      usage in clean when used by means of CDBS (combined with above change,
      now fully closes: #247171)
    + [HE] Check Build-Depends(-Indep) for virtual packages without a
      real dependency. Fix based on patch by Steinar H. Gunderson
      <sgunderson@bigfoot.com>. (Closes: #255593)
    + [HE] Don't issue virtual-package-depends-without-real-package-depends
      if this happens in Suggests. (Closes: #254367)
    + [FL] Allow whitespace in relations after the version number
  * checks/huge-usr-share:
    + [FL] Skip check for packages that don't have usr/share at all
      (Closes: #247708)
  * checks/manpages:
    + [FL] Comment check for no-manpage-in-correct-directory out until
      I know if it's worth keeping it at all (Closes: #253011)
      Thanks to Stephen Stafford for pointing this out.
  * checks/menus:
    + [FL] Fix regex which checks for update-menus calls (missing
      whitespace) and allow path before executable name (perhaps this
      should be another warning, though?) (Closes: #254420)
    + [FL] Some clean-up and warn that wm-menu-config is deprecated
      (Closes: #248997)
    + [FL] Demote executable-in-usr-lib-menu to warning as executables
      are supported (but seldom used) (Closes: #254498)
  * checks/menu-format:
    + [FL] Fix su-to-root checks to cope with the new -X option and
      improve the option parsing to better handle unknown options
    + [FL] Allow a comma separated list in the package test. Pointed
      out by Gerfried Fuchs (Closes: #246507) Change incorrect-package-test
      to pkg-not-in-package-test which is issued when the package is
      not in the list. Don't issue menu-command-not-in-package when
      we have a list.
    + [FL] Commands for window manager's modules can't be expected
      to be available as executables, so don't issue
      menu-command-not-in-package in this case. Thanks to
      Manoj Srivastava for reporting (Closes: #247805)
    + [HE] Change menu-command-not-in-package to also look into the standard
      PATH. (Closes: #255155)
  * checks/po-debconf:
    + [JvW] Simply fail if stuff from gettext is missing.
  * checks/scripts:
    + [FL] Don't issue executable-not-elf-or-script for files
      that are named *.exe (Closes: #251075, #255083)
    + [CW] Add python2.4 as a valid interpreter (Closes: #254482)
    + [FL] Add ruby1.[68] as valid interpreters, introduce new
      ruby-script-but-no-ruby-dep error, copied from the python stuff
    + [FL] Don't issue script-not-executable for menu-methods. There
      are reasons why they are sometimes not executable (Closes: #250632)
    + [FL] 'and' and 'or' are no bash keywords (Closes: #194283)
  * checks/shared-libs:
    + [FL] Don't report shlib-with-executable-bit and
      shlib-with-bad-permissions on symbolic links to such files
    + [JvW] Fix the pic-detection code (Closes: #185816)

  * debian/{control,rules}, frontend/lintian:
    + [JvW] Insert version number at package build time, no need to commit a
      change to frontend/lintian on every version number change... Requires
      sed version 4 at build-time.
    + [JvW] Start depending on gettext.
    + [JvW] Start depending on libdigest-md5-perl on woody, for using md5 on
      files.

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [JvW] Partial rewrite: checks are now plugins loaded into lintian,
      rather than executed as separate executables. Makes it easy to make
      common functions available, tags are done centrally, etc etc. Should
      also save quite a number of forks, thus more speedier.

  * lib/Util.pm:
    + [FL] dpkg supports comments in control files now, handle them
      correctly
    + [FL] a space after the colon is not mandatory in dpkg control
      files

  * man/lintian.1:
    + [FL] Document new control-file check script

  * reporting/harness:
    + [FL] Correctly support udeb packages
  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [FL] Correctly support udeb packages
    + [FL] Remove some unused code for bug references
  * reporting/bug.status:
    + [FL] Remove

  * testset/filenames:
    + [JvW] Fix two lintian warnings in lintian itself by touching files only
      on clean target, and not distributing them in the source

  * unpack/list-srcpkg:
    + [FL] Some packages don't specify a standards-version, e.g. d-i ones.
      Prevent Perl warnings.
  * unpack/list-udebpkg:
    + [FL] Fix sort of copy & paste error which caused the whole
      script to behave ill
  * unpack/unpack-binpkg-l2:
    + [FL] While fixing permissions, also enable write access
      so we get no problems on removal. Disable group write
      permissions, we need nobody to interfere with us.

  Frank Lichtenheld and Jeroen van Wolffelaar.

  * [FL] add udeb support (Closes: #216117)

    frontend/lintian, checks/debconf and checks/files

  * checks/binaries:
    + [JvW] Ignore static binaries in /usr/lib/debug
  * checks/changelog-file:
    + [HE] Check for the debmake template email address in the changelog
      entries. Patch by Steffen Moeller <moeller@pzr.uni-rostock.de>,
      thanks! (Closes: #199903)
    + [JvW] Loosen up checks for -0.x versions, could be either native or
      upstream + Debian revision, so some tests cannot be performed because of
      that uncertainty
  * checks/copyright-file:
    + [HE] Change usr-doc-symlink-to-foreign-package check to throw an
      error when a package doesn't depend on the *same* version of the
      package its /usr/share/doc/$foo dir is symlinked to. This is supposed
      to ensure that both come from the same source and the same source
      version. (Closes: #201470)
  * checks/cruft.desc:
    + [HE] Reworded some parts and bumped the Standards-Version after
      checking for changes. (Closes: #235735)
  * checks/debconf{,.desc}:
    + [JvW] Add an error for a bogus default for a boolean template
      (Closes: #236846)
    + [HE] Check for duplicate fields in templates. Fix based on
      patch by Denis Barbier <barbier@linuxfr.org>, thanks! (Closes: #233116)
    + [HE] Check if the translation of a Choices: field is empty, leading to
      skipped questions. (Closes: #149451)
  * checks/debdiff:
    + [HE] Check for accidental native packaging. This is done by checking for
      a dash in the version number (though -0.\d+ and -0.\d+.\d+ are allowed
      for (binary) NMUs) and the existence of a .diff.gz. (Closes: #216327)
    + [JvW] Implement source-tar-is-posix-tar, which checks for upstream
      tarballs that are tar --posix tarballs, which cannot be untarred by the
      tar version in woody (Closes: #245138)
  * checks/debhelper{,.desc}:
    + [JvW] Add error if debian/compat is empty, happens once in current
      sid and gave internal error before

    + [HE] Add check for the debmake template email address. Patch by Steffen
      Moeller <moeller@pzr.uni-rostock.de>, thanks!
  * checks/deb-format:
    + [HE] Add a check for the data member of a deb. dpkg 1.11 introduces
      support for configurable compression algorithms (bzip2, for example),
      but this shouldn't be allowed before dpkg 1.11 hits stable.
      (Closes: #159874)
  * checks/fields:
    + [HE, FL] Nearly complete rewrite for clean up:
      - bad-relation seems to work better now (Closes: #171763)
      - duplicate relations checking now works for different fields, too
        (Closes: #234978, #235356)
    + [HE] Add check for an Origin field with "Debian" as value.
      (Closes: #119618)
    + [HE] Reintroduce build-depends-without-arch-dep check with the patch
      I proposed in #214231. (Closes: #242484)
    + [JvW] Check for well-formed Debian-revision
    + [JvW] Check for correct realname when QA mailaddress used
  * checks/fields.desc:
    + [FL] Fix some wrong policy references
  * checks/files:
    + [HE] New check for compiled python files (*.pyc). Patch by David
      Kimdon <david@kimdon.org>, thanks. (Closes: #236606)
    + [HE] Check for gzipped zero byte files. (Closes: #172052)
    + [FL] Don't complain about read-only *.ali files as requested by
       Ludovic Brenta. This makes #226879 wishlist again.
    + [FL] Warn about ancient files with the value of
      Dinstall::CutOffPastYear from dak CVS as limit.
      (Closes: #204801, #218304)
    + [HE] Check for *.ali files introduced, warn if their permissions are !=
      0444. (Closes: #226879)
    + [HE] New checks for deprecated X11 dirs (/usr/{bin,lib,include}/X11 and
      usr/X11R6/*). (Closes: #81004)
    + [HE] Check for README for other distributions/platforms and warn if
      they're installed. Based on patch by Jay Bonci. (Closes: #178441)
  * checks/init.d:
    + [FL] output-of-updaterc.d-not-redirected-to-dev-null should be
      only an info tag since it is more an aesthetical issue, not a
      policy violation. (Closes: #149700)
  * checks/lintian.desc:
    + [JvW] Added missing Type: tags
  * checks/manpages:
    + [FL] New checks:
       - Section number of directory and file differ
       - Section number of file differs from what is expected
         from the location of the binary. (Closes: #203831)
    + [FL] Parse contents of man page and implement more new checks:
      - Section number of file and header differ (Closes: #89488)
      - Try to search for hyphens that should be minus signs
        (Closes: #205924). First patch by Eduard Bloch, final
        regex by Josip Rodin.
      - Search for FSSTND directories referenced in man pages. Only
        an info tag. (Closes: #111098)
    + [FL, HE] Fix false positives of
      manpage-for-non-x11-binary-in-wrong-directory when a link
      from a normal bin/ is pointing to a binary in an X11 dir. Based
      on patch by FL. (Closes: #203389)
    + [JvW] x11-games-should-be-in-usr-games is now error, because it's
      mandated by policy
  * checks/menus:
    + [JvW] Stricter checking for whether update-menus is actually called
      (Closes: #244628)
  * checks/menu-format:
    + [FL] Only issue one warning about needs=dwww, not two
    + [HE] Check if the command given with command= is in the package
      (Closes: #199346)
  * checks/nmu{,desc}:
    + [JvW] New series of checks: Check whether NMU's have correct NMU version
      number, and whether maintainer uploads have correct maintainer version.
      Also, check whether NMU's and QA uploads are identified as such in the
      changelog (Closes: #111948)
  * checks/scripts:
    + [FL] Add /usr/bin/php as valid interpreter. (Closes: #239115)
      Thanks to Peter Eisentraut for pointing this change out
    + [FL] Reflect new suidperl handling. /usr/bin/suidperl
      shouldn't/can't be called directly anymore so add a new
      error and remove it from the list of usual interpreters.
      (Closes: #240806)
    + [HE] Don't warn about files with a shebang line which are not executable
      when they are called *in, as they're probably just templates. (Closes:
      #114740)
  * checks/shared-libs:
    + [HE] Add some new logic to cope with symlinks from /usr/lib to another
      dir to fix false positives of postrm-has-useless-call-to-ldconfig and
      friends. (Closes: #190714)
    + [HE] Also handle case statements in postrm scripts. (Closes: #179435)
  * checks/standards-version:
    + [JvW] Also emit warning if standards version is 3.6.0, and not yet 3.6.1

  * collection/diffstat
    + [HE] The diff.gz file name does not include the epoch, so strip it
      before trying to get the file.
  * collection/override-file:
    + [FL] add support for source overrides (Closes: #129510)
      See the User Manual for more information.
  * collection/source-control-file:
    + [FL] New collection script to extract field information
      from debian/control in source packages. Currently used
      in checks/debhelper to guess udeb packages.

  * debian/control,debian/copyright:
    + [FL] Add Marc 'HE' Brockschmidt to Uploaders and
      to copyright file

  * doc/lintian.sgml:
    + [FL] Some updates, some more verbatim explanations
      (Closes: #197955)
    + [FL] Reworked the override section to handle udeb and
      source packages, too
  * doc/README:
    + [FL] Update options

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [HE] Added a --dont-check-parts|-X option to allow users to specify
      which tests should not be run. Also added infos about this to the
      manpage. (Closes: #206674)
  * frontend/lintian-info:
    + [JvW] Fixed that lintian -I also displays info for I: entries

  * lib/Dep.pm:
    + [FL] Fixed some semantic errors (since no one ever observed the
      corresponding perl warnings the fixed parts are probably never
      used in the current code)
  * lib/Utils.pm
    + [HE] Changed {read,parse}_dpkg_control a bit to cope with the fact
      that template files sometimes contain lines consisting only of
      whitespace which do *not* separate to blocks. (Closes: #242479)

  * testset/runtests:
    + [JvW] Rewrote so that it is actually useful:
      - sort output to nullify filesystem directory ordering differences
      - run lintian just once
      - check that all tests that are triggered have a description, if verbose
        specified, warn about tests that are not tested

  * unpack/list-binpkg:
    + [HE] Try to open Packages.gz if no Packages file can be found. Fix
      based on patch by Robert Lemmen <robertle@semistable.com>, thanks!
      (Closes: #198617)

lintian (1.22.12) unstable; urgency=low

  The ``Fix those false positives, mkay'' release, prepared for all Debian
  Maintainers by Frank Lichtenheld and Jeroen van Wolffelaar.
  Best served cold.

  * debian/control:
    + [FL] Make Uploaders a single line field. It didn't really
      break, but at least DDPO had its difficulties

  * man/lintian.1:
    + [FL] sync man page with the --help output by adding missing options
      Based on a patch by Robert Lemmen. (Closes: #198615)
    + [FL] sync man page with the current list of checks and collection
      scripts

  * checks/binaries:
    + [FL] Don't complain about non-stripped kernel modules.
      Patch by Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsaker (Closes: #203373)
    + [JvW] Exclude binaries and packages named *-static from the
      binary-is-static test. Exception for sash removed. (Closes: #215235)
  * checks/changelog-file:
    + [FL] Check that encoding of changelog file is UTF-8, based on a patch by
      Denis Barbier (Closes: #175318)
  * checks/copyright-file{,.desc}:
    + [FL] Don't advise to point to the perl packages' copyright file.
      Thanks to Martin Orr for pointing this out. (Closes: #193293)
    + [FL] Fixed false positives of
      copyright-should-refer-to-common-license-file-for-gpl due to
      the GFDL. Thanks to Ross Burton for reporting this. (Closes: #192278)
  * checks/deb-format{,.desc}:
    + [JvW] Fix perl variable-name clash causing unusually formatted error
      output (only important if you do automatic processing on it)
    + [FL] The current script is by Denis Barbier, correcting author in
      .desc file
  * checks/debhelper.desc:
    + [FL] correct reference to debhelper manpage. It's debhelper(7), not
      debhelper(1). Thanks to Brian Nelson for pointing this out
      (Closes: #188245)
  * checks/debconf:
    + [JvW] Update valid types, since currently 'title' is supported now too
      (Closes: #234379, #234608)
  * checks/description:
    + [FL] fix description-is-dh_make-template check. (Closes: #215125)
      Fix suggested by Josip Rodin
  * checks/etcfiles.desc:
    + [FL] correcting abbreviation of etcfiles to 'etc', was 'ini' which
      is already used by init.d
  * checks/fields:
    + [FL] Really check only "real" dependency fields for needless
      depends (Closes: #185035)
    + [JvW] Don't consider depending on coreutils bad, as this is in a way a
      versioned depend (Closes: #216536)
    + [FL] Remove the build-depends-without-arch-dep check. It produces
      way too much false positives and can only be replaced by
      a sophisticated debian/rules parser
      (Closes: #192037, #202950, #214231)
    + [JvW] Test syntax of Uploaders: too
    + [JvW] Accept more whitespace in relations, which is allowed according to
      policy, thanks Adrian Bunk for noticing, FL for patch (Closes: #200280)
  * checks/filenames:
    + [JvW] Revised the symlink detection stuff, it is now more rigorous, and
      has separate warning for recursive symlinks that are otherwise not
      necessarily wrong (Closes: #118080)
  * checks/files:
    + [FL] only issue package-installs-nonbinary-perl-in-usr-lib-perl5 if
      there is no binary perl file at all in the package, since this
      reflects the way the Installer module behaves (Closes: #199898)
  * checks/huge-usr-share:
    + [JvW] Check for a big /usr/share (currently 1-2MB will trigger it) in
      arch-dependent packages. Currently just I:. Thanks Steve McIntyre for
      the idea. (Closes: #232849)
  * checks/menus{,.desc}:
    + [FL] Remove non-executable-in-etc-menu-methods as it doesn't
      reflects the current menu manual (Closes: #229460)
  * checks/po-debconf:
    + [JvW] Check whether files listed in debian/po/POTFILES.in actually
      exist, and only positively detect po-debconf usage if dependency is
      there. (Patch by Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org>, only minimally
      modified)
  * checks/scripts:
    + [FL] Fix check for "exec ..." line. Fix suggested by Josip Rodin.
      (Closes: #212811)
    + [JvW] Tighten up mknod, dpkg --print-architecture and killall detection
      in maintainer scripts, would need rewrite to be really sane.
      (Closes: #148548, #161820, #192300)
  * checks/shared-libs:
    + [FL] Be more tolerant to variations when checking for
      postrm-unsafe-ldconfig. Thanks to Martin Godisch, Steinar H. Gunderson
      and Aidas Kasparas for their input. (Closes: #218543, #233740)

  * unpack/unpack-binpkg-l1:
    + [FL] tar uses now h to signal hardlinks which breaks a lot of our code.
      so sed'ing it away. Many many thanks to Theodore Y. Ts'o for bringing
      this to our attention (Closes: #234545)

     + Rewrite in Perl
     + Obsolete PO files are no more checked because po2debconf now
       automatically runs debconf-updatepo if PO files are older than
       templates files.  Of course PO files might be outdated (e.g. when
       downloaded from a BR), but it should occur seldom.

  * config.* files from 2000-09-05 and such had the timestamp in a
    variable called version, not timestamp, so check for that as well
    to detect the really old ones as well.
  * Made sharedobject-in-library-directory-not-actually-a-shlib an E
    because it uses the same method as
    pkg-has-shlibs-control-file-but-no-actual-shared-libs does, and that
    one's pretty reliable and already E, closes: #197951
  * Fixed logic error in detecting whether the uncompressed changelog
    file is really a symlink, closes: #198171.
  * Ripped out those few remaining bits of code that watched over /usr/doc,

  * Don't whine about policy 3.5.10. No changes.
  * Avoid install-docs' --no-update-menus when checking for update-menus

  * Close the IN filehandle in menus:check_script() so that $. gets
    properly reset (sloppy coding -- argh!).
  * Fixed a $1 overwriting thinko in debhelper checks.
  * Demoted build-depends-without-arch-dep from E to W. "Most likely"

  * Allow /usr/lib/$pkg in the rpath check, thanks to Matej Vela,

  * Added code to check for bad-so-link-within-manual-page.
  * Also added code to check for empty-manual-page.
  * Added a few more cases of safe ldconfig invocation in postrm,

lintian (1.22.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed some random glitches.
  * Change rgb-vs-cmap to first include the hex codes of colors in cmap.xpm,
    and then go searching for names in rgb.txt. Updated the cmap.xpm
    location in the description. This hopefully really closes: #170860.
  * Added exception in the shell syntax checks for evil rep scripts,
    thanks to Kevin Ryde, closes: #171175.
  * Added checks for multiple dependencies on libstdc, tcl, tclx, tk, tkx
    and libpng packages. This is currently being done in a hardcoded manner,
    but that should do for now, closes: #80447, #129548.
  * Added a regression test as part of the relations regression test for
    the above multiple dependencies.
  * Don't barf on /var/local in the FSSTND-dir-in-var check, just in
    non-standard-dir-in-var, closes: #119414. The normal packages
    shouldn't install anything there anyway, and base-files can have
    overrides :)
  * Prepend a slash to the file names in file-in-etc-not-marked-as-conffile,
    closes: #122285. We already don't have the prepended thing normalized,
    so why not indulge this.
  * Added dh_suidregister-is-obsolete, closes: #94031.
  * Added copyright-lists-upstream-authors-with-dh_make-boilerplate,
    closes: #107815. I am now the official maintainer so I get to do that >:)
    This time I've written the description much better, so there should
    be no confusion like there was the last time.
  * Added description-synopsis-is-duplicated first by comparing the
    lowercased synopsis with the lowercased start of the extended
    description, and then if that fails, the letters and numbers are
    removed and the strings are compared. This may not catch _everything_,
    but should be satisfactory, and it closes: #118098.
  * Added a regression test for the above error to the other relations test.
    It seemed handy. :)
  * Added an error for depending on libdb1-compat, just in case, as advised
    by Colin Watson.

    closes: #136831. The description may be considered vague for some
    cases, but I'll wait until someone actually complains about that

  * Moved the generic exceptions before the script-without-interpreter check,

  * Based on hints from in Jim Van Zandt's otherwise rather flawed patch
    posted in bug #94928, moved the diff file stuff from the cruft check
    into the diffstat collector, and made it simply extract the patch into
    a file called "debian-patch" which is then used elsewhere, instead of
    zcatting it over and over again.
  * Added a regression test for the debian/files and config.* checks.
  * Added config.log to the list of configure-generated files to warn about.
  * Updated menu icon colors with a little script I wrote, closes: #170860.
  * It appears File::Find has changed semantics since woody and now refuses
    to follow a symlink as the name of the directory to scan. Obviously,
    a simple readlink() fixes it.
  * I realized that bug #122855 couldn't have been fixed the diff scanning
    code anyhow, since dpkg-source ignores file deletions in the first place.
    Removed the hours of work and simply expanded on the description of the
    error instead. Oh well.
  * Added an error for GPL copyrights that don't refer to
    /usr/share/common-licenses, thanks to Edward Betts, closes: #99885.
  * Added a warning for some popular architecture-independent image files
    in /usr/lib which suggests moving them to /usr/share per FHS, thanks to

  * Further updated the python script checks to ignore obsolete -base
    packages and watch versioned python interpreters better, thanks

    Added the word obsolete in the name of the error and a paragraph break
    to further clarify it.
  * Added Apps/Science as a valid menu section. This and the removal of
    the error for calling ldconfig anywhere in the postinst in 1.21.5

  * There doesn't appear to be any provision in the Policy or in the FHS
    for random compatibility symlinks, so I've just added "or symbolic
    link" to the description of file-in-unusual-dir, closes: #135546.
  * Fixed the regexp for package-contains-CVS-dir to actually recognize
    directories that are printed with the trailing slash, closes: #146831.
  * Made unregistered-script-in-etc-init.d a warning, renamed it to
    script-in-etc-init.d-not-registered-via-update-rc.d and updated
    its description to mention why it may not be an error, closes: #118823.
  * Added dash into the regexps in the scripts check.
  * Added a crude check for code within another shell (foosh -c something).
    I say crude because it works with oneliners only -- anything that spans
    lines sounds like pretty much impossible to do in without actually
    _being_ a shell script interpreter :) closes: #166483.
  * Added an exception for /etc/ppp being 750 root:dip, and complain if
    it exists and it's not like that, closes: #169260.

    Also extend the checking of that directory on all X.Y and not just 1.5.
  * Fixed policy references in several init script related tags, made the
    init.d not conffile check a warning since Policy allows otherwise and we
    can't check reliably, extended the rc.d file check on rc(\d|S).d and
    excluded sysvinit and file-rc from the check. All this closes: #118824.

    remotely valid reason to do this. This should explain bugs like #159474
    and #162813 to the submitters, but I'll have to wait and see, since
    I still can't reproduce it myself.
  * Fixed the cruft check not to check the diff file just once, not for
    every damn subdirectory of the source, d'oh.

  * Changed the default path for ksh to /bin/ksh, as per the change
    in the pdksh package, closes: #131484.
    Maybe /usr/bin/ksh should still be allowed, but it seems inconsistent
    to allow several paths like that... perhaps the same should be done
    for zsh? Although, I suppose there are less zsh scripts out there
    compared to ksh.
  * Added $link to the usr-doc-symlink-to-foreign-package error message,
    hopefully properly closes: #116309 (untested).
  * Eradicated the remaining Packaging Manual references, from
    Chris Tillman's patch in #116488. Also removed FSSTND references.
  * Fixed typo in description-is-dh_make-template, closes: #145802.

    thanks Matej, closes: #157423.

    override files, thanks to Colin in #158119. Maybe this is all wrong,
    but it shouldn't hurt anyway. :)
  * Added Colin's patch check manual pages for correctness with lexprog,
    along with the appropriate versioned dependency on man-db, closes: #52524.
  * Cleaned up some typos in copyrights.
  * Added *sh -n checking for syntax errors in shell scripts, closes: #42348.
  * Moved script checks from control-files to the second part of scripts,
    and also noticed and fixed a bug -- if a script e.g. called killall and
    had a bashism on the same line, it would escape undetected.
  * Check the .diff.gz file (if it exists) for config.(cache|status) that
    includes no added and a number of removed lines and don't print the
    configure-generated-file-in-source error for those files, closes: #122855.
    The diff output analysis isn't perfect, but it oughta work.
  * Clarified the virtual-package-depends-without-real-package-depends
    warning with an additional paragraph, closes: #164813.
  * Updated the testset/check_info.pl to work, similarly to lintian-info.
  * Updated the testsets (this verified my s/elsif/if/g bug fix in

lintian (1.20.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * 'wearing my "fuck redhat" shirt and loving it' release

    fails for people who do not use the -f option to rm (or any other options)
    thanks Oliver Elphick, Closes: #88182
  * checks/scripts handles 'wish' better (I hope), Closes: #88333
  * checks/debconf, the registry check is ignore if the package being tested
    is debconf itself.  Closes: #88526
  * frontend handles files that are referenced but do not exist better
  * this is looking like one of the last releases for a while

    Closes: #85876, #84759
  * checks/menus now checks for proper use of install-info,
    Closes: #25823, #30192
    need a testset for this too
  * checks/files.desc now points to the FHS in /usr/share/doc/debian-policy
  * applied Joey Hess' app-defaults patch.  This allows app-defaults to be
    conffiles as well as adding a check for app-defaults in old dirs.
    Closes: #86707, #76811
  * lintian now knows more about 3.5.x's X policy in 12.8.  Added check for
    Xresources file but no conflicts on xbase (<< 3.3.2.3a-2).  Closes: #63542
  * applied Joey Hess's perl patch.  Now know that pm's in /usr/share have
    no need for the +x bit.  Closes: #86709
  * check for INSTALL in /usr/share/doc now knows about INSTALL\..+ (i.e.
    INSTALL.gz)
  * checks/standards-version has an error for packages which declare a source
    relation (ie Build-Depends) but are not at least policy 3.1.x.
    Closes: #86711
  * checks/fields now checks that the arch definition in source relations
    follows policy.  Closes: #86710
  * added wish8.3 to list of known interpreters in checks/scripts
  * warning description cleanups, Closes: #87528
  * added more bashism checks -- '|&', '$[foo]', '${parm:len[:offset]}',

    Closes: #32113 (the suidregister stuff happened a release or three ago)
    you guessed it, need a testset
  * bashism check now tells you what it thinks the bashism was.
    Closes: #81738
  * bashism checks now ignore here documents, Closes: #87527
    teset/maintainer-scripts now has a here document in a script and extended
    bash triggers.
    Also, various other bashism test cleanups and improvements.
  * typo in scripts fixed, now I really do work on python2, thanks Jerome.
    Closes: #87772
  * hmm, versioned-provides message was often wrong, made it better and it
    reports the perceived relation, i.e. foo (= 4).
  * removed the -w and strict from reporting/ scripts
  * update-menus checks enhanced with knowledge about wm-menu-config.
  * added 'asmodule' to list of known menu tags
  * depends-on-essential-package-without-using-version now is only reported
    for actual depends or pre-depends.
  * interpreter checking handles arbitrary whitespace now
  * fixed scripts check for ocaml, now know about ocamlrun.
  * unusual-interpreter messages were being caused by not prepending '.' to
    the interpreter name when checking %executables in checks/scripts.
  * still more fun with ++ )-:  menus is now even more paranoid with
    quotemeta().
  * ensure $setuid, $setgid is set in checks/files, thanks to the luxman
    package for triggering the perl oops.
  * collections/scripts handles files that only contain '#!'.

lintian (1.20.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * 'people who depend on side effects should be flogged' release
  * lintian had code which set a variable to undef, then used it.  Without
    -w and use strict, this silently became a zero, but now it causes errors.
    So, since it obviously was meant to be zero, I set it to zero instead of
    undef.  Closes: #85326
    Fun part was this only happened when run on more than one version of a
    single package i.e. lintian foo_1.changes foo_2.changes.
  * checks/scripts updated to deal with python2.x and there being two versions
    of python.  Closes: #85441
    while doing this, collections/scripts was updated to support the use of
    /usr/bin/env.  I probably added bugs here )-:
    added a scripts testset, very early still.
  * my modification to checks/menus to support /usr/share/doc/package -> other
    had a problem with special chars.  Now calls quotemeta().  Annoying because
    I have a ++ package name but it did not trigger this particular case.
    So, I added a package to foo++ which links to foo++.  Closes: #85530
  * added a TODO to the private dir.
  * left off a closes in the big perl closings 2 revisions ago, Closes: #80192

lintian (1.20.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * 'people who name a lib libfoo-X.X.so should be shot' release
  * checks/shared-libs handles libraries of the form 'libfoo-X.X.so' now
  * the virtual package check I added in the last release failed to check
    the field it was testing, so errors were reported on fields other than
    Depends.  Ooops.  The description also should have referred to packaging
    not policy.  Closes: #85225

 -- Sean 'Shaleh' Perry <shaleh@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Feb 2001 13:55:10 -0800

lintian (1.20.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * 'why would you ever do THAT?' release
  * lintian-info sets $ENV{'LINTIAN_ROOT'} if it is not set
  * added a check to checks/files for packages which ship the upstream INSTALL
    document.  This is almost always useless for users of a package.
    testset/binary now includes such a file
    Closes: #81970
  * checks/menus -- the walk over package contents now has logic to run file
    tests on files, link tests on links, etc.
  * checks/menus -- if there is a /usr/share/doc/$pkg symlink, assume it links
    to a package it depends on and do not warn about setting the usr/doc
    symlink.  There is code in checks/copyright-file that makes sure policy is
    followed with regards to what is actually linked against.  Closes: #48048
  * checks/fields is now less strict about Section: non-US handling
  * added debconf files to list of known control files in checks/control-files
    Closes: #46863
  * perl mistakes are no longer checked for. Closes: #47076, #75889
  * FHS 2.1 cleanups, Closes: #75878
  * lintian will not complain if you symlink your doc directory to an essential
    package and leave off the depends, because since it is essential you must
    not depend on it.  Closes: #48296
  * lintian now gives and error when a package declares a depends on an
    essential package without using a versioned depends.  Closes: #33250
  * extra-license-file is not given if the file is just a symlink.
    Closes: #35224
  * checks/fields: now complain if a package declares a depends on a virtual
    package without first depending on a real packages as an alternative.
    Required adding a known_virtual_packages list to checks/common_data.pl.
    Also removed redundant info/registered-virtual-packages file.
    Closes: #70673
  * added a library (mostly empty right now) and non-us testset
  * runtests now runs the tests in alphabetical order
  * lintian's --version info is being updated automagically again
  * moved some hashes around in checks/ to common_data.pl
  * checks/changelog-file reorganized so it knows the size of the files.  Now
    it can check that the changelog is sufficiently large to require
    compressing.  Also modified the desc file to reflect this. Closes: #84400
  * --info now outputs all info.  Silly bug in how I used split and defined.
    Closes: #82970
  * added a testset/check_info.pl script.  It verifies that every lintian
    check referenced in a desc also has an info section.  runtests now runs
    this test as well.
  * suidregister warning is now an error.
  * checks/menus: fixed the if link case pattern match -- one more perl error
    down, 3 billion hidden ones to go.
  * Following items thanks to Colin Watson
  * updated checks/standards-version so it does not give perl errors when it
    encounters a newer standards version than it knows about. Closes: #84083
  * updated references to policy for policy 3.5.0. Closes: #84088, #83969
  * Added a warning for packages containing a link to undocumented(7) as
    suggested on debian-policy list.  Also includes a testset (manpages)
    addition.
    Closes: #83188
  * At the moment checks/copyright-file just tests for a slash in the link;
    I've changed it here to test for an initial / or ../, and then after that
    check it strips off everything from the first slash on, so that tests on
    the package name work correctly when people link to subdirectories of
    other /usr/share/doc directories.  Closes: #84066
  * It was unpacking to level 2 even though I had Unpack-Level: 1 and no
    associated collection scripts. Of course, it wanted override files from
    /usr/share/lintian/overrides/$pkg. Fair enough - except that if I said
    --no-override it wanted the override file information anyway, and still
    unpacked to level 2.  No obeys non-overrides.  Closes: #84722

  * 'Where or where did my changes go' release
  * fixed --help option to not show escaped chars
  * changed regression test to also do a run with --info on
  * seems lintian always used the lintian-info script from the path, changed
    to look in LINTIAN_ROOT if passed
  * perl problems cleaned up, Closes: #82970
  * removed randomization of output strings when referring to policy documents,
    not only is this silly but it makes regression tests impossible
  * moved manual_refs.pl list of policy manuals to an external file.  This will
    allow automated updating when releases occur.  It also removes the perl
    warnings (-:

lintian (1.20.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * the change hurts release
  * every perl script now calls use strict and passes -w to perl
    The long road of bug tracking because of this has begun.  Thanks Joey H.
  * testset/filenames now has a lengthy-symlink bug to show how that code works
  * typo in checks/control-files in a bashism check, the correct POSIX call
    is 'read foo' however the code was checking for the existence of whitespace
    before the call, not the existence of the variable to read into due to a
    mixed up regex.  Thanks Adam Heath for pointing this out. Closes: #81453
  * checks/control-files, the check for whether '.' takes more than one
    argument did not take into account things like 'and'.  It does now.
    Closes: #81737
  * fixed interpreter check code to hand a space between the #! and the
    interpreter (really), also allows bash,ksh,ash as valid sh shells. Also
    knows to look for an ELF header and stop parsing the script. Thanks
    Colin Watson.  Closes: #80348, #82541
  * testet/binary-1 added.  This is a small C program to test lintian's
    handling of binary files.  See the changelog in this directory for info
  * fixed message for 'manpage-has-wrong-extension', Closes: #82452
  * 'N: Unknown interpreter' message now only printed once per script,
    Closes: #81644
  * added equivalent file-directly-in-usr-share-doc messages (et al.),
    Closes: #82654
  * added new message: suidregister-used-in-maintainer-script. this replaces
    the old messages suidregister-used-in-maintainer-script-other-than-postinst
    and suidunregister-not-called-in-postrm due to suidregister being phased
    out of Debian.  Closes: #81868

  * more fun with interpreter checking, seems a space is allowed between bang
    and the interp path.  So, fixed the regex (again).  Also store the name

    allow for other interpreter checks later.  Closes: #80348

  * checks/control-files now checks if the postrm calls update-alternatives
    with the --remove option, this is considered harmful, Closes: #80255
    checks/control-files.desc explains the problem in detail
  * fixed checks/menus setting of is_sh, $foo = split() sets foo to the number
    of items, not the first item -- duh (-:  How did this make it thru testing?
    added a maintainer-scripts testset to help catch this in the future

  * removed references to libtool-workarounds.txt (it never died ....),
    Closes: #78420
  * my reformat of the code in checks/menu-format changed the regex from
    m/^#/ to m/^	#/, I changed it back (kind of).  The test is now
    m/^\s*\#/ just in case a space snuck in.  Also modified the code so it
    does a if (m//) { next;} rather than if (! m//) { ........ }.
    Closes: #78532
  * checks/menus now checks which interpreter the maint script uses and varies
    its checks accordingly -- works for sh and perl currently, Closes: #78880
    Updated menus.desc while I was at it.
  * fixed typo in scripts.desc, pike error message should have referred to pike
    not to make, Closes: #79744
  * killed use of \b in bashism checks, now uses (^|\s+), Closes: #80122

      top of menu files.
    + Changed the relative shared-library check to look for either
      rela.text or rel.text, not just rel.text.  This is needed for PowerPC
      and other non-i386 architectures.
    + Added ruby as a valid interpreter
    + Added notice when unrecognized file format is found that it might be
      due to a missing package: binutils-multiarch

     + Changed file error message to indicate it's file's
       fault(closes: #37259)
     + Changed perl depends to perl | perl5 to cover both

lintian (1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Richard's changes:
     + When reporting errors in .changes files, report filenames the way
       they were listed, rather than as absolute pathnames.
     + Don't exit with code 1 for errors that were overridden.
       This fixes bug#37353, reported by Wichert Akkerman.
     + Correctly handle escaped characters in menu items (bug pointed
       out by Raphael Hertzog).
     + bltwish scripts should now depend on blt, not blt8.0.
       This fixes bug#38092, reported by Gordon Russell.
  * Darren's changes:
     + override requested by christian kurz for ppp.  Several of the
       files/dirs have non-standard permissions.
     + override requested by adam kleine for gtk-engines-gtkstep.  Contains
       libraries not meant to be linked.
	 + override requested by Manoj Srivastava for latex2html.  Fixes
       bug#38098.
     + hugs added to the list of interpreters.  Fixes bug#37668 reported by

    + For install-docs, accept --remove as well as -r.  Fixes bug#35664,
      reported by James Van Zandt.
    + In explanatory text for prerm-does-not-call-installdocs, give a
      correct example for the prerm (not the postinst).  Fixes bug#35665,
      reported by James Van Zandt.
    + List gmp2 as obsolete package (replaced by libgmp2).
    + Don't generate depends-on-obsolete-package for -dev and -dbg packages
      that depend on their library.
  * Darren's changes:
    + override requested by julian gilbey for menu.  Menu can't call
      update-menus in postrm since it won't exist then.
    + added requested override for vtwm update menus.  Fixes bug#36457
      reported by Branden Robinson
    + override requested by Oliver Elphick for postgresql-pl.  Has shared

		This closes wishlist bug#33827, reported by Joey Hess.
    + Mark all versions of libgtk1.1 as obsolete for

lintian (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Zapped compiled-with-bad-libc check.
  * Corrected spelling error in spelling check (it flagged "interchangeable"
    as a bad word; this should have been "interchangable").  This fixes
    bug#33252, reported by Santiago Vila.
  * Silenced non-standard-dir-in-usr check about /usr/$arch-linuxlibc1/,
    which will go away at some point and is not worth moving now.
    I'll file a policy proposal for it at some point.  This fixes
    bug#33114, reported by Marcus Brinkmann, and bug#33374, reported
    by James Troup
  * Silenced non-standard-dir-in-var check about /var/www/, since it's
    Debian policy to use it.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Thu, 25 Feb 1999 14:43:27 +0100

lintian (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New tags:
      E: non-standard-toplevel-dir
      W: non-standard-dir-in-usr
      W: non-standard-dir-in-var
      W: file-in-unusual-dir
      E: dir-or-file-in-mnt
      E: binary-in-etc
      E: use-of-compat-symlink
      E: subdir-in-bin
    These cover much of the FSSTND and FHS.

  * No longer emit executable-in-usr-doc for scripts.  It's just too
    controversial.  I've added an info-level tag script-in-usr-doc
    for people who are interested.  This closes bug#28560, by
    Stephane Bortzmeyer.

  * Only emit compiled-with-bad-libc if the register_frame symbols
    are UNdefined.  This closes bug#31867, submitted by Michael Meskes.

  * Don't emit compiled-with-bad-libc for binaries linked to
    libgnustep_base.so.0, which also defines __register_frame_info.
    This closes bug#31004, submitted by Matthias Klose.

  * Changed a lot of "error:" messages to "internal error:", to make
    clear that they are errors in Lintian's execution, not in the package
    being checked.  This closes bug#31013, submitted by James Troup.

  * (frontend/lintian) Select STDOUT again after closing OUTPUT_PIPE.
    This fixes bug#31574, reported by Julian Gilbey.  Thanks for the patch!

  * (checks/copyright-file) Lintian was confused by "libident(=0.22-1)",
    i.e. without separating whitespace.  Fixed.  This closes bug#31821,
    reported by Paul Slootman.

  * Man page fix: mention that lintian can be run on .changes files.
  * Depcheck pages: fixed version comparison bug.

lintian (0.9.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Do not abort when run as root; print a warning instead.
    --allow-root still overrides the warning.

  * Only generate non-standard-file-permissions-for-etc-init.d-script
    tag for regular files.  Reported by Martin Schulze.

  * Corrected libtool-workaround sample configure.in snippet:
    Look for *-*-linux-gnu, not *-pc-linux-gnu.
    Fixes bug#30756, reported by James Troup.

  * Made lintian abort with an error message when objdump can't handle
    a binary's file format.  Also made lintian Suggest binutils-multiarch.

  * New error tag: arch-dependent-file-in-usr-share
    This closes bug#30742, reported by Matthias Klose.

  * Added gnuplot as a known interpreter.  Suggestion by Rafael Laboissiere.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Sun, 20 Dec 1998 18:05:46 +0100

lintian (0.9.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * New features (summary):
    - 112 new spelling corrections.
    - Minor efficiency improvements.
    - Checks __register_frame_info problems.
    - Updated to policy 2.5.0

  * (lib/util.pl) Exit with code 2 when failing, like the manpage says.
  * (checks/files) Print octal permissions in
    bad-permissions-for-etc-cron.d-script, not decimal.
  * (checks/files)
    Ignore .xpm extensions too when hunting for extra license files.
  * (checks/conffiles, checks/conffiles.desc)
    Renamed -may-not-be- tags to -must-not-be-, for clarity.

  * Replaced most bash scripts with perl scripts, for faster startup times
    and fewer subprocesses.  This speeds up lintian by some 30% on my machine.
  * (collection/objdump-info)
    Add -T flag, to collect dynamic symbols table too.
  * (checks/binaries)
    Look for __register_frame_info and __unregister_frame_info.
    New tag: compiled-with-bad-libc

  * (checks/*.desc) Use new (2.5.0) section numbering for policy references.
  * (checks/changelog-file) Accept changelog.html.gz files.
  * (checks/standards-version) newer-standards-version is warning, not error.
    This fixes bug#29366, reported by Julian Gilbey <jdg@maths.qmw.ac.uk>.
  * (checks/standards-version) Updated to standards-version 2.5.0.

  * (info/overrides) New overrides.
    Fixes bug#29449 reported by Marcus Brinkmann (libc5 overrides)

  * (checks/standards-version.desc) Remove the link to the upgrading-checklist,
    which I can no longer find and which is probably not maintained anymore.

  * (checks/control-files) Fix check for mknod-in-maintainer script:
    pipes are made with p, not -p.

  * (debian/control) In the package description, mention which policy
    version Lintian checks.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Mon, 23 Nov 1998 14:46:32 +0100

lintian (0.9.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * (checks/binaries) Warn if a package with ELF binaries does not have
    a Depends line.  New tag: missing-depends-line.
    (Suggested by Charles Briscoe-Smith)

  * (checks/menus) Don't warn about /usr/lib/menu/README.
    (Noted by joost witteveen)

  * (checks/binaries.desc, checks/binaries, checks/shared-libs.desc)
    Renamed "shlib-without-dependency-information" to
    "shared-lib-without-dependency-information", to avoid confusion with
    the shlibs control file.  (Suggested by Branden Robinson)
    Also moved the tag info from shared-libs.desc to binaries.desc, where
    it belongs.

  * (checks/shared-libs)
    Suppress "shlib-with-executable-bit" error if a library has an
    INTERP header.  This catches the libraries (such as libc or libm)
    that print a little banner when executed.

  * (checks/fields)
    Report maintainer addresses that have no dots in the domain part.
    (Suggestion by James Troup)
  * Teach fields check about non-us.

  * (info/perl-modules)  Updated modules info.
  * (lib/deplib.pl)  Fixed handling of versioned dependencies.

  * (checks/files.desc)  In executable-in-usr-doc tag, suggest examples
    directory as a place for executables.
    (Suggestion by Stephane Bortzmeyer)

  * (checks/fields, checks/fields.desc)
    New tag: depends-on-obsolete-package, to flag dependencies on
    old libraries.

  * Look for more misspellings:
      dependant -> dependent, dependancy -> dependency,
      definate -> definite, definately -> definitely.
  * (checks/scripts) Correctly deal with the terminating newline when
    parsing dependency lines.  Fixed bug#27694, reported by Rob Tillotson.
  * (checks/menu-format) Added Apps/Technical and Apps/Hamradio as sections.
  * (checks/copyright-file)
    Don't report copyright-file-is-gpl unless it is GPL version 2.
    This fixes bug#27793, reported by Milan Zamazal.
  * (checks/menus) Add newline after bad-menu-file-name tag!
  * (lib/manual_refs.pl) Update urls to manual sections, so that
    they refer to www.debian.org.  Regenerate index of devref sections.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Thu, 15 Oct 1998 14:06:26 +0200

lintian (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * (frontend/lintian, reporting/html_reports, checks/*, collection/*)
    Make rigorous distinction between source and binary packages.
    Pass "source" or "binary" as second argument to check scripts.
    Report source package tags with "pkg source:" instead of just "pkg:".
    Binary package tags stay the same.
    (The check scripts always report "pkg type:", and the frontend strips
     the type again if it's "binary").
    This involves several changes in the web-report scripts as well.

  * Add command-line options for the things that could only be set via
    environment variables or the configuration file.  (--cfg, --root,
    --lab, --dist, --arch).

  * Really rename obsolete-ldconfig-call-in-postinst to
    postinst-has-useless-call-to-ldconfig.
  * Really rename changelog-file-missing-in-native-debian-package to
    changelog-file-missing-in-native-package

  * (checks/scripts) bltwish now lives in blt8.0, not blt4.2.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Sun, 20 Sep 1998 16:34:38 +0200

lintian (0.8.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * (checks/menu-format) Added "sort" as a known tag; it's documented in
    the menu package.  This fixes bug#26373, reported by Marcelo E. Magallon.

  * (checks/scripts, checks/scripts.desc)  Added /usr/bin/js as a known
    interpreter (in ngs-js), as suggested by Brian Bassett.

  * (checks/shared-libs)  Brian Bassett reported inaccuracies in detection
    of "ldconfig" calls in maintainer scripts.  Fixed.

  * (checks/menu-format)  Skip checks on "section" if the "needs" tag had an
    unknown value.  This deals with bug#26375, reported by Marcelo E. Magallon.

  * (checks/manpages)  Fixed: check for links to "undocumented" manpage
    should not react to link destinations like "ilu-undocumented".

  * changelog-file-missing-in-native-debian-package shortened to
    changelog-file-missing-in-native-package
  * wrong-name-for-changelog-file-of-native-debian-package shortened to
    wrong-name-for-changelog-of-native-package.

lintian (0.8.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ignore common programming-language extensions when looking for
    extra-license-files.  (Fixes bug#26252, reported by Manoj Srivastava,
    who had a file vm-license.el).

  * Use -z flag for tar, rather than piping through gzip -dc explicitly.
    This allows tar to detect and pass on errors reported by gzip.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Tue,  1 Sep 1998 11:57:53 +0200

lintian (0.8.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added /usr/bin/guile and /usr/bin/scsh as known interpreters.
    (This fixes bug#26093, reported by Karl M. Hegbloom <karlheg@debian.org>)

  * Renamed tags:
       postinst-contains-obsolete-call-to-updatemenus
    to postinst-has-useless-call-to-update-menus
       postrm-contains-obsolete-call-to-updatemenus

       postinst-contains-obsolete-call-to-installdocs
    to postinst-has-useless-call-to-install-docs
       postrm-contains-obsolete-call-to-installdocs
    to postrm-has-useless-call-to-install-docs
       obsolete-ldconfig-call-in-postinst
    to postinst-has-useless-call-to-ldconfig
    The first two are also downgraded from error to warning.
    (This fixes bug#26118, reported by Wichert Akkerman <wakkerma@debian.org>)

  * Renamed tag use-of-killall-in-maintainer-script to killall-is-dangerous.

  * More overrides.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Thu, 27 Aug 1998 18:56:03 +0200

lintian (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * (checks/perl) Don't emit warnings for perl scripts in /usr/doc.
    This closed bug#25728, reported by Manoj Srivastava.

  * (info/overrides) Change the non-standard-*-perm overrides to match
    the new format of those tags.  (was changed in 0.7.5)

  * (checks/control-files)
    "possibly-insecure-handling-of-tmp-files-in-maintainer-script" now knows
    about mkdir.
    New tag: W: possible-bashism-in-maintainer-script (Suggestion by Joey Hess)

  * (testset/filenames-2)  Don't rely on installer's umask for testset.

  * (collection/menu-files, collection/menu-files.desc,
     checks/menu-format, checks/menu-format.desc)
    New check for correct syntax in "menu" files, written by Joey Hess.
    New tags:
      E: old-format-menu-file
      E: whitespace-after-continuation-character
      E: bad-test-in-menu-item
      E: unparsable-menu-item
      W: incorrect-package-test
      W: duplicated-tag-in-menu-item
      W: menu-item-missing-important-tag
      W: menu-item-contains-unknown-tag
      W: menu-item-uses-icon-none
      W: menu-item-needs-tag-has-unknown-value
      E: menu-item-adds-to-root-menu
      W: menu-item-uses-apps-games-section
      W: menu-item-creates-new-section
      E: menu-item-creates-new-root-section
    The check follows current practice on two sections:
      Window-managers -> WindowManagers
      Screen/Screen-saver -> Screen/Save
    The menu docs will be updated to match.

  * (lib/pipeline.pl) Bugfix: Use syscall SYS_exit when exiting from
    children that failed to exec, because the perl function exit() would
    run END blocks and such.

  * (checks/standards-version) By now, 2.2.0.0 is more than one year old;
    mark it as 'ancient'.

  * (reporting/html_reports) Bugfix: Apply quotehtml() to the tag text
    *before* adding links to bug pages.

  * Many small adjustments to checks:
  * (checks/scripts) Be less picky about package names when checking
    dependencies.  (The check was confused by the package blt4.2)
  * (checks/description) Ignore case when looking for synopsis lines
    that start with the package name.
  * (checks/files) Don't give executable-in-usr-doc error for executables
    in /usr/doc/examples/, since that directory does contain examples, and
    it's already flagged by old-style-example-dir.
  * (checks/control-files) Don't warn about references to "/tmp" unless the
    full filename is "/tmp" or "/var/tmp".
  * (checks/binaries) Split tag "binary-not-linked-against-libc" into
    "program" and "library" tags.
  * (checks/files, checks/scripts) New tag "executable-manpage", which
    replaces "executable-not-elf-or-script" for manpages.
  * (checks/files) Shortened file-directly-in-usr-share-not-in-a-sub-directory
    and file-directly-in-usr-doc-not-in-a-sub-directory to just
    file-directly-in-usr-share and file-directly-in-usr-doc.
  * (checks/md5sums) Added md5sums-control-file-is-empty tag, to avoid
    spewing many file-missing-in-md5sums errors in that case.
  * (checks/scripts) Suppress interpreter-not-absolute tag if the
    filename ends in .in and the interpreter looks like #!@PERL@
  * (checks/control-files) Suppress mknod-in-maintainer-script tag if
    mknod was called with -p.
  * (checks/shared-libs) Emit no-shlibs-control-file tag for each shared lib
    found, rather than just once.
  * (checks/files) Emit old-style-example-dir only for directories, not for
    every file.
  * (checks/perl) perl-script-needs-dependency
    Bugfix: realize that a package does not need to depend on itself.
  * (checks/description) possible-unindented-list-in-extended-description:
    Only emit this tag if there are at least two things that look like
    list items.
  * (checks/scripts) List /usr/bin/env as a known interpreter.
  * (checks/binaries) unstripped-binary-or-object:
    Instead of an exception for /lib/modules specifically, suppress this
    tag for all .o files.
  * (checks/control-files) Bugfix: check for == bashism works now.
  * (checks/files) Introduced new tag lengthy-symlink, which supersedes
    and corrects the relative-symlink-enters-same-toplevel-directory tag.

  * (man/lintian.1) Document the check and collection scripts added to
    lintian in the last few months. (oops)

  * (collection/perlmods, checks/perl)
    Refined scanner so that fewer spurious perl-script-uses-unknown-module
    tags are emitted.
    Perl tags are no longer 'Experimental'.

lintian (0.7.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * (checks/perl) Exchanged order of arguments in
    perl-script-needs-dependency tag, for clarity.
  * (info/perl-modules) Added some module dependencies.

  * (info/overrides) More overrides.

  * (checks/shared-libs, checks/shared-libs.desc)
    Fixed: erroneous shlib-missing-in-control-file if a shared library
    had more than one symlink to it.
  * Renamed obsolete-shlib-entry-in-control-file to
    unused-shlib-entry-in-control-file.

  * (checks/copyright-file) Changed size-requirement for copyright-file-is-gpl
    tag from 17000 to 12000 bytes, because some packages (casio) extracted
    only the "TERMS AND CONDITIONS" part, which is shorter.

  * (reporting/html_reports) Count packages as well as tags, in tag index.

  * (checks/control-files, checks/control-files.desc)
    New tag: W: mknod-in-maintainer-script

  * (checks/files, checks/files.desc)
    New tags:
       W: package-installs-into-etc-rc.boot   (rc.boot is obsolete)
       W: extra-license-file                  (for COPYING files, etc)

  * (checks/shared-libs, frontend/lintian)
    Get rid of dependency on File::Basename; use a simple regexp instead.

lintian (0.7.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * (collection/perlmods)
    Fixed: perl script scanner is now POD-aware.
    This should cut down on the number of spurious warnings.

  * (doc/CREDITS)
    Install credits file.  My apologies if I have forgotten anyone.
    There were far more people than I would have guessed -- Thanks to all! :-)

  * (checks/perl)
    Skip 'autouse' keyword when parsing use and require directives.

  * (frontend/lintian)
    When processing a .changes file, turn md5sum checks OFF by default.
    A new -m flag is provided to turn them back on.
    The .dsc file is still always checked.

  * (frontend/lintian)
    Saner interrupt handling.  Lintian now dies immediately if ^C is hit,
    and does remove the temporary lab (if any).  This is mostly a side
    effect of avoiding system() (in favour of the new functions in
    lib/pipeline.pl), but did involve some tinkering about with perl's
    signal handling.  Thanks to Ruud de Rooij and Graydon Hoare for
    their help.  This closes bug#24975, reported by Yann Dirson.

  * (checks/copyright)
    Fixed copyright-is-gpl tag so that it actually works.

  * (lib/dep.pl, checks/perl, checks/perl.desc, info/perl-modules)
    Much smarter perl module analysis.  Lintian now has a list of
    perl modules and the packages that provide them (in info/perl-modules),
    and a dependency processor (in lib/dep.pl), and uses these to
    check "use" and "require" lines in perl scripts.
    New tags:
      W: perl-script-needs-dependency  (Experimental)
      W: perl-script-uses-unknown-module  (Experimental)
    Tag "script-needs-full-perl" has been dropped.

lintian (0.7.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * (frontend/lintian)
    Fixed: --display-infotags option wasn't working.

  * (reporting/harness, reporting/html_reports)
    Have the archive check generate infotags but not display them on the
    web pages.  This way they are still available in the log file.

  * (checks/fields, checks/fields.desc)
    New tag: W: doc-package-depends-on-main-package

  * (checks/menus, checks/menus.desc)
    New tag: E: bad-menu-file-name
    This is emitted for packages that install "/usr/lib/menu/menu", which
    overlaps with the menu package.  (I've seen it happen a couple of times).

  * (checks/binaries, checks/binaries.desc)
    Allow unstripped-binary-or-object for any package with "debug" in its
    name.  (This is in addition to the exception already made for "-dbg").
    Allow binary-not-linked-against-libc for libc itself :-)

  * (lib/pipeline.pl)
    New helper functions for starting pipelines from perl scripts, without
    involving the shell.  This makes it easier to pass filenames literally,
    and often saves a shell invocation.
  * (collection/diffstat, frontend/lintian, unpack/*)
    Use the new pipeline functions.

  * (checks/description, checks/description.desc)
    New tag:
      E: description-is-debmake-template

  * (reporting/html_reports)
    Quote < and > in displayed tags (such as occurs in email addresses).
    This fixes the maintainer-name-missing tag output.

  * (checks/copyright-file, checks/copyright-file.desc)
    New tag:
      E: copyright-file-is-gpl
    Generated for copyright files that contain the complete GPL text.

lintian (0.7.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * (unpack/unpack-srcpkg-l1, unpack/unpack-binpkg-l1, unpack/unpack-binpkg-l2)
    Speedup: replaced system("mkdir ...") with mkdir() calls.
  * (unpack/unpack-binpkg-l1)
    Speedup: avoid extracting control info twice.
    More speedups are possible here.
  * (unpack/unpack-binpkg-l1, unpack/unpack-binpkg-l2)
    Speedup: avoid using dpkg-deb to unpack debs; construct a pipeline
    with ar, gzip, and tar instead.  It turns out to be far faster.
  * Together, these changes made for a speed increase of some 30%
    when checking packages that have to be unpacked.

lintian (0.7.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * (reporting/html_reports)
    Fixed: Print bug number with tags that were reported as bugs.

  * (checks/scripts, checks/scripts.desc)
    Added /usr/bin/expect (provided by expect) as known interpreter.

  * (unpack/unpack-srcpkg-l2)
    Fixed: chmod -R the right directory when unpacking a source package.

  * (collection/diffstat, collection/diffstat.desc)
    New collection script that runs diffstat on the Debian diff.
  * (debian/control)
    Depend on diffstat, version >= 1.27-1 so that it can parse Debian diffs.
  * (checks/debdiff, checks/debdiff.desc)
    New check that look at the filenames included in the Debian diff.
    New tag:
      W: patch-failure-file-in-diff foo.rej

  * (checks/control-files, checks/control-files.desc)
    New tag:
      W: dpkg-print-architecture-in-maintainer-script
    (dpkg --print-installation-architecture should be used there)

lintian (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * (reporting/html_reports)
    - Rewritten (more modular).
    - Create a page for each different tag, which gives the lintian-info
      for that tag and then lists all occurrences of that tag, with each
      tag line also being a link back to the page for the package in
      which it occurs.
      This closes bug#21390, reported by Gregory S. Stark <gsstark@mit.edu>.
    - Instead of listing the lintian-info text with every different tag
      in every package, make every tag a link to the page for that tag
      (which will have the lintian-info for it at the top).
      This should make the reports a lot smaller, and also more readable.
    - Make a "Sorted by tag types" page and link to it from the index page.
  * (doc/TODO) Entries [L3] and [L4] now complete.

  * (checks/spelling, checks/spelling.desc)
    Check README.Debian file as well, since we now collect it anyway
    for the readme-debian-is-debmake-template tag.
    New tag:
       E: spelling-error-in-readme-debian

  * (checks/fields) Added hurd-i386 to the list of known architectures, at
    the request of Marcus Brinkmann <brinkmds@rz.ruhr-uni-bochum.de>.

  * (checks/scripts, checks/scripts.desc)
    Added trs to the list of known interpreters, as /usr/bin/trs provided
    by konwert.  Suggestion by Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>.  This
    closed bug#24998.

  * (checks/files)
    - Fixed: tags dir-in-user-local and file-in-usr-local did not print
      the filename involved.
    - Fixed: some tags were erroneously output as "setuid-gid-binary"
      even though only one of suid or sgid was set.

  * (checks/fields)
    - Fixed: change a few cases of "maintainer-address-malformed"
      to "maintainer-name-missing".

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Tue,  4 Aug 1998 19:45:47 +0200

lintian (0.6.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Inserted GPL boilerplate text in every file whose format allowed comments.

  * (doc/lintian.sgml) Use new <url> tag.

  * (info/overrides) New override for the file in kbd-data with the strange
    name.  Having lintian handle that file correctly would be too expensive.
    This "closes" bug#25107.

  * (checks/control-files, checks/control-files.desc)
    New tag: use-of-killall-in-maintainer-script (experimental)
    Added at the recommendation of Santiago Vila <sanvila@unex.es>.
    This closes bug#22206.

  * (depcheck/deppages.pl, reporting/html_reports)
    Added arm and hurd-i386 to the list of architectures to check.

  * (doc/libtool-rpath-workaround.txt, checks/binaries.desc)
    Revamped doc file at Rob Browning's suggestion, and renamed it to
    doc/libtool-workarounds.txt because it describes both -rpath and -lc
    workarounds.  Updated the info for the tags binary-not-linked-against-libc
    and binary-or-shlib-defines-rpath to refer to the new file.

  * (doc/desc-files)  Moved from private/DESC.
    Briefly describes the meanings of the fields used in lintian's .desc files.

  * (doc/TODO)
    Updated and restructured version of what used to be in private/TODO,
    various bugreports and mailed suggestions.  This will become the
    central place for potential improvements to lintian.  I hope that
    having it in /usr/doc/lintian will inspire some people to help.

lintian (0.6.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * (checks/shared-libs)
    Corrected bug that made lintian complain about shared modules without
    version info (thus ending in ".so") with a "non-dev-pkg-with-shlib-symlink"
    warning.

  * (info/overrides)  Added overrides:
    libtricks is like fakeroot; nothing is compiled with it.
      libtricks: no-shlibs-control-file
    slrnpull has been split off from slrn, and shares some of its overrides.
      slrnpull: non-standard-dir-perm var/spool/slrnpull/ 2755
      This fixes bug#24668, reported by Joey Hess.

  * (collection/perlmods)
    Collector script that greps perl scripts for use and require directives.
  * (checks/perl, checks/perl.desc)
    New check script that checks perl "use" and "require" directives.
    New tags:
       E: script-needs-perl-version   (Experimental)
       W: script-needs-full-perl      (Experimental)
       I: cannot-parse-perl-directive

  * (frontend/lintian)
    New flag --print-version that prints the unadorned version number.
  * (reporting/config, reporting/html_reports)
    Instead of requiring $LINTIAN_VERSION in the config file, query the
    lintian frontend for the version number.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Sun, 19 Jul 1998 16:41:39 +0200

lintian (0.5.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * (reporting/html_reports)
    Lintian web pages now use dists/unstable/main in the path for
    "Getting Lintian", rather than hamm/hamm, where it doesn't exist anymore.
    (Pointed out by Ruud de Rooij)

  * (checks/scripts)
    Add /usr/sbin/install-fvwmgenmenu as a known interpreter.
    This fixes bug#23783, reported by Joost Kooij.

  * (checks/binaries, checks/changelog-file, checks/manpages)
    [speedup] Don't skip blank lines in file-info file, since there
    shouldn't be any.

  * (checks/manpages.desc)
    - Added note to manpage-in-wrong-directory info that only
      sections 1 through 9 should be used.  Refer to policy 5.1.
    I had a rewrite of the manpages check in the works, but I deferred
    it to a later lintian version.

  * (info/overrides)
    New override from Joel Klecker: binutils: no-shlibs-control-file.
    Added overrides supplied by Joey Hess, in bugreport #24425.

  * (checks/changelog-file)
    Corrected regexp used for changelog-file-not-compressed;
    This really fixes bug#23683, reported by Joey Hess.

  * (checks/files)
    New warning: package-installs-perllocal-pod, inspired by
    Manoj Srivasta's recent bugreports about such files.

  * (checks/fields.desc)
    No longer experimental:
      E: alternates-not-allowed
      E: versioned-provides
      E: bad-version-in-relation

lintian (0.5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added overrides supplied by Ray Dassen.

  * (frontend/lintian-info)
    Made lintian-info aware of X (experimental) tags.  (oops)
  * (lib/read_taginfo.pl)
    Add a paragraph to the info output for experimental tags that explains
    what experimental status means.

  * Added test package "relationships" to test weird dependency lines.

  * (frontend/lintian)
    Instead of specifying /usr/bin/lintian-info, use just lintian-info
    and let the path search find the script.

lintian (0.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * (checks/menus) The menu package doesn't need to check for the
    existence of update-menus :-)

  * (testset/runtests) A harness for running regression tests on Lintian.
  * (testset/*) A collection of broken packages on which to test Lintian.
    Currently, only an empty package is provided for testing.
  * (debian/rules) Run the tests in the build target.
  * (checks/*.desc) Added "Tested: empty" to tags that are tested for
    with the "empty" testpackage.

  * (collection/file-info) Use a better parser for the index file, so
    that weird filenames are handled correctly.  This fixes bug#24079.
  * (collection/md5sums) Adapt index-file parser from file-info collector,
    this saves a "find" operation on the unpacked tree.
  * New test package filenames-1, which contains various evil filenames.

  * (checks/shared-libs, checks/menus, checks/manpages, checks/files,
     checks/control-files)
    Handle filenames that contain spaces correctly.

  * (frontend/lintian, reporting/config)
    Update version number.  This fixes bug #23555, reported by Yann Dirson.
    These will have to be kept in sync manually, because the lintian
    source package has to be directly usable by the lintian web page
    generator.

  * (checks/changelog-file)
    Allow the upstream changelog to be a symbolic link.
    As a side-effect, allow it for the Debian changelog too.
    This handles bug#23300, reported by Manoj Srivastava.

  * (checks/changelog-file, checks/changelog-file.desc)
    The wrong-name tags are now warnings, not errors, because the
    relevant section of policy uses "should usually".
    This fixes bug#23757, reported by Gregory S. Stark.

  * (checks/changelog-file)
    Limited the changelog-file-not-compressed tag to only complain
    about changelog and changelog.Debian, because policy 5.8 does not
    mention other changelogs.  (These would fall under section 5.3, I guess.)
    This fixes bug#23683, reported by Joey Hess.

lintian (0.4.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * (checks/fields)
    New error tag: "multiline-field" flags control fields that span multiple
    lines when they shouldn't.  (According to the Packaging manual,
    "Except where otherwise stated only a single line of data is allowed").

  * (checks/fields)
    Check dependency relationship fields as well.
    New tags:
      E: alternates-not-allowed
           (generated for use of | in Provides, Conflicts, and Replaces fields)
      E: versioned-provides
           (generated for Provides fields that use a versioned package name)
      W: obsolete-relation-form
           (generated for use of < and > in versioned relationships)
      W: bad-version-in-relation
           (generated if the version number in a versioned relation
            is not syntactically correct)
      E: bad-relation
           (generated if lintian cannot parse an element of a dependency line)
      W: package-relation-with-self

  * (checks/fields)
    Bugfix to maintainer-not-full-name tag, it works now.
    Added maintainer-address-looks-weird warning for obscure cases.
    I doubt anyone will ever see it.

  * (checks/fields)
    Added new-essential-package warning, to highlight such packages.

  * (checks/fields.desc) Descriptions of new tags.

  * Removed Christian's name wherever it appeared as a contact address.

  * (depcheck/buglist) Entered newly reported bug numbers for dependency
    problems.

  * (checks/menus) Distinguish between install-docs and install-docs -r.
    (closes #23049).

  * (checks/files) Added new tag backup-file-in-package.  This warns
    about emacs-style backup files that got installed in a package.

  * (frontend/lintian) Allow I: tags to be overridden just like any other.

  * (frontend/lintian) Add support for "Experimental" tags.  These are
    handled like other tags, but an "Experimental: yes" flag in the tag
    description tells lintian to output them with "X:" rather than "E:"
    or "W:" or "I:".  This is used for new tags that might still misbehave.

  * (doc/lintian.sgml) Add a paragraph to explain the new tag type.
    "The displayed message is one of types listed above, but has been
     flagged as `experimental' by the Lintian maintainers.  This means
     that the code that generates this message is not as well tested as
     the rest of Lintian, and might still give surprising results.  Feel
     free to ignore Experimental messages that do not seem to make sense,
     though of course bug reports are always welcomed."

lintian (0.4.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * (debian/control)
    Lintian now depends on perl, since perl-base is not enough. It already
    uses Text::Wrap, which is only in perl, and soon it will also use
    Getopt::Long.

  * (reporting/html_reports)
    Report all dates in GMT, in rfc822 format.

  * (debian/rules)
    In clean target, delete byte-compiled python files (*.pyc) as well.

  * (depcheck/dependencies.py)
    Check "Cannot satisfy without packages in base" before checking
    "Cannot satisfy with required packages", because a dependency will
    be listed in only one category, and the former is more important
    to flag.

  * (frontend/lintian)
    Rewrote option handling to use Getopt::Long, thus allowing nifty
    features like bundling of single-character options.  Closes wishlist
    bug#22566.

lintian (0.4.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * (depcheck/) New directory, containing scripts for generating reports
    about broken dependency relationships in the main distribution.
    These are not installed by the lintian deb, they are intended for
    use by the lintian web pages, which use the source package directly.
  * (reports/harness) Added hooks to call the depcheck scripts to generate
    the depcheck page.
  * (reports/html_reports) Add links from the lintian root page to the
    depcheck page.

  * (checks/menus) A tag was still generating "existance" while its
    description had been corrected to "existence"; the html report
    generator complained about that.  Fixed.

  * (unpack/list-binpkg) Bugfix in lintian --setup-lab.  Instead of
    looking for files in binary-$arch and binary-all, look only in
    binary-$arch and follow the symlinks.

  * (lib/text_utils.pl) Changed "&maint;" name from Christian Schwarz
    to Richard Braakman, and changed mail address to lintian-maint@debian.org.

  * (checks/standards-version) If checking a package with a Standards-Version
    that is newer than the one lintian is written for, warn that lintian
    should be upgraded.  (closes: #22919).
  * (checks/standards-version.dsc)
    New tag: newer-standards-version

  * (checks/debian-readme) New check: at James Troup's suggestion,
    scan for unmodified deb-make templates in README.Debian files.
    New tags:
      readme-debian-is-debmake-template
      readme-debian-contains-debmake-template
  * (checks/debian-readme.desc) Describe new tags.
  * (collection/debian-readme) New collection script for README.Debian file.
  * (man/lintian.1) Describe new check and collection script.

  * (doc/libtool-rpath-workaround.txt) Explain how to achieve the same
    result without touching configure.in and rerunning autoconf, provided
    certain conditions hold.

  * (lib/text_utils.pl, frontend/lintian-info, reporting/html_reports)
    Do not split words that are longer than a line.  This fixes the
    "Poli cy" bug in the lintian HTML reports.

  * (checks/standards-version.desc) Corrected the URL to Christian's
    policy upgrading checklist, which seems to have changed from
    "upgrading.html" to "upgrading-checklist.html".

  * (info/override) Removed another *.pm warning, I missed it the last time.

lintian (0.4.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * (checks/scripts) Suppress script-not-executable warnings for files
    in /usr/lib that match *.pm.  These are perl modules, which often
    have a #!/usr/bin/perl line at the top but are not intended to be
    executed directly.
  * (info/override) Removed now-suppressed warnings from the overrides file.

  * (info/override) Added more overrides.  (closes #21028).

  * (checks/scripts) At Oliver Elphick's suggestion, do not emit
    *-script-but-no-*-dep tags or csh-considered-harmful tags for
    scripts that are not executable.  (These already produce a
    script-not-executable warning).

  * (checks/binaries) At Yann Dirson's suggestion, added a tag for
    stripped binaries that still have the .comment and .note sections.
    This tag is info-level, thus not normally displayed.
    dh_strip and install -s have been patched to strip these sections,
    but most of the distribution has not been recompiled with the patched
    versions.
  * (checks/binaries.desc) Described the new tag.
    (closes #22495).

  * (man/lintian.1) Documented the options that were added in lintian 0.4.3.

  * (checks/fields) Produce informational tags no-section-field and
    no-priority-field.  These were removed in a previous version, because
    nearly all packages do not pass -isp to dpkg-gencontrol when building
    packages, but the new handling of info-level tags makes them useful again.

lintian (0.4.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Christian added more overrides.
  * debian/control: New maintainer.
  * debian/copyright: Mention that lintian has no separate upstream source.
  * debian/rules: Got rid of 'dirs' file.
  * Moved manpages from doc/ to man/ in source package.
  * debian/rules: Restyled :-)
  * New overrides, read all about them in /usr/share/lintian/info/overrides.
    (closes #22001)
  * Corrected typo in frontend, added --allow-root option at Johnie Ingram's
    suggestion to override lintian's refusal to run as root.  (closes #22162).
  * Ran ispell over .desc files, fixing lots of typos, including the
    word "existance" which occurs in several tags.
  * checks/files: At the advice of the python maintainer, added a warning
    against files installed in /usr/lib/python1.5 that are not in the
    site-packages subdirectory.  (closes #22236)
  * checks/fields: Reduced unknown-field-in-dsc and unknown-field-in-control
    tags from "warning" to "info", because such fields can only be
    introduced deliberately anyway.  ("info" tags are not normally reported,
    but can be queried when someone is interested.)  (closes #20521)
  * Made the above comment about info tags true, by adding a --display-info
    option.

lintian (0.4.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * This release contains updates for Policy 2.4.1

  * Fixed `changelog' check:
    - don't report not-max-compression tag if changelog file is a symbolic
      link (thanks to Santiago for noticing that! fixes:bug#20842)

  * Improved `description' check:
    - recognize if extended description is `Missing'
      (fixes:bug#21091)

  * Changed `files' check:
    - symbolic links within /etc and /var have to be relative!

  * Fixed `scripts' check:
    - package name is "blt4.2", not "btl4.2" :)

  * Updated `shared-libraries' check:
    - check if postinst calls ldconfig if shared libraries are installed
      in a directory controlled by ld.so
      (fixes:bug#20414)
    [2 new tags]

  * Changed `standards-version' check:
    - added Standards-Version 2.4.1
    - only check first there digits of Standards-Version field

  * Changes to the `lintian' frontend:
    - unused overrides are displayed per package
    - display `Processing changes file...'
    - use $TMPDIR environment variable for creation of the temporary lab
      (fixes:bug#21092)
    - clean up lab if C-C is pressed

lintian (0.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changes which make it possible to check the whole archive with Lintian
    each day without having to check all packages all the time:
    - Reworked creation and handling of info/{binary,source}-packages files:
      - the list files contain a version number now, which allows checking
        for old file formats
      - each entry has a timestamp now
      - don't remove $LAB/info/ directory on --setup-lab
      - just process changed packages when doing --setup-lab
    - added command line option: `-p X' makes lintian only process all
      packages which are listed in file X
    - changed meaning of command line option `-U': specifies info to
      collect _in addition to_ the usual info (necessary to extract
      the changelog files on master--see below)

  * Improved `binaries' check:
    - objects and binaries in a *-dbg package may be unstripped
    - libraries in lib/profile or lib/debug may not be stripped
      (suggested by Fabrizio)
    [1 new tag]

  * Added new `changelog' check
    (thanks to Juan Cespedes for the idea! fixes:bug#19695)

  * Improved `control-files' check:
    - improved RE that searches maintainer scripts for /tmp security bugs

  * Improved `description' check:
    - fixed RE to check for description-starts-with-package-name
      (thanks to Roderick Schertler)

  * Fixed `fields' check:
    - internal: check for source pkg using "-l dsc" instead of "-e dsc"

  * Fixed `files' check:
    - disabled possible-name-space-pollution tag since policy is not
      defined yet

  * Improved `manpages' check:
    - fixed silly typo in binary-without-manpage tag info
      (thanks to Robert Edmonds for noticing that!)
    - disabled tag binary-without-manpage for `versioned binaries'
      (thanks to Dirk for the suggestion! fixes:bug#20186)

  * Fixed `menu' check:
    - report maintainer-script-does-not-check... tag only once per package
      and maintainer script
    - recognize `$(which update-menus)' as valid check for the existence
      of update-menus; same for install-docs
      (thanks to Fabrizio for pointing this out!)
    - recognize `command -v update-menus' as valid check for the existence
      of update-menus; same for install-docs
      (thanks to Adam P. Harris for pointing this out! fixes:bug#20759)
    - fixed tag infos
      (thanks to Adam P. Harris for the input! fixes:bug#19810)

  * Improved `scripts' check:
    - added new interpreters:
        nawk, pike, rexx, regina, burlap, wish8.0, bltwish
      (fixes:bug#20223)

  * Improved `shared-libs' check:
    - added check if shared libraries contain non-pic code
      (thanks to Gregory S. Stark for the idea and the patch!
       fixes:bug#19249)
    [1 new tag]

  * Added `changelog' collector script
    This makes it possible for Lintian to extract all changelog files
    on master for use by Apt (fixes:bug#20546)

  * Incremented LAB_FORMAT version to 3 because of
    incompatible changes in the objdump-info collector script

  * Internal: fixed bug in read_dpkg_control() utility function: empty
    tags have not been handled correctly

  * Internal: html-reporting tool: don't chop of text after hash (#)

  * Added a lot new overrides and removed unused overrides
    (fixes:bug#20017,bug#20082,bug#19562)

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Apr 1998 21:58:42 +0200

lintian (0.3.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix release:
    - check if lab in /tmp already exists (fixes security bug#19799)
      Thanks to James Troup for noticing this and thanks to Joey Hess
      for providing a patch!

  * Added one override entry

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Mar 1998 23:28:38 +0100

lintian (0.3.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix release:
    - `unknown-control-file du' message disappeared
    - fixed `executable-in-usr-doc' to not display files in
      /usr/doc/<pkg>/example
    - fixed tag parameters for
        bad-owner-for-doc-file
        dir-or-file-in-opt

  * Added overrides

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Mon, 16 Mar 1998 08:44:34 +0100

lintian (0.3.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is (intentionally) an `unstable' upload--we've decided to not
    include the lintian package in `frozen' since it doesn't make sense to
    maintain a `stable' and `unstable' version of a package in such an
    early state. The maintainers should get Lintian from the `unstable'
    distribution to check `frozen' uploads though.

  * Added `menus' check. This check checks for common mistakes WRT
    /usr/lib/menu and /usr/share/doc-base files.
    [16 new tags]

  * Fixed `shared-libs' check:
    - removed `shared-library-uses-its-soname' check since this produced
      way too many false alarms (thanks to David Engel for the input!)

  * Fixed `binaries' check:
    - skip `unstripped-binary-or-object' check for kernel modules
      (thanks to Michael Meskes for noticing that!)
    - fixed pattern which parses the `file' command's output to be able
      to handle files without info text correctly
      (thanks to James R. Van Zandt for pointing this out!)
    - mention in tag info that shared libs should be stripped with
      `--strip-unneeded' options (thanks to Brian for pointing this out!)

  * Improved `manpages' check:
    - check if manual pages are compressed with gzip -9
      (thanks to Holger Rusch for the idea!)
      [2 new tags]

  * Improved `files' check:
    - for files in /usr/doc:
      - executables may only be in /usr/doc/<something>/examples
      - files should be owned by root.root (thanks to Joey)
      - files should not be directly placed into /usr/doc/
  	(fixes:bug#19485)
    - no files may be installed into /tmp and /var/tmp
    - renamed file-directly-in-usr-share to
      file-directly-in-usr-share-not-in-a-sub-directory
      (thanks to Santiago)
    - fix tag info for "symlink-should-be-absolute"
    [3 new tags]

  * Improved `description' check:
    - lists (starting with a dash or asterisk) have to be indented
      (thanks to cpb4@ukc.ac.uk for the idea and the patch!
      fixes:bug#19481)
    [1 new tag]

  * Fixed `scripts' check:
    - packages with python scripts might depend on python or python-base
      (thanks to Gregor Hoffleit for pointing this out and to Richard for
      the patch! fixes:bug#19162)
    - remove wrong policy quotation for `script-not-executable' tag

  * Fixed `init.d' check:
    - ignore update-rc.d calls in preinst and postinst scripts, if
      "remove" option is specified (thanks to Roman Hodek and Herbert Xu
      for pointing this out--this change also removes a lot of other false
      alarms WRT update-rc.d calls)

  * Improved `control-files' check:
    - scan maintainer scripts for references to /tmp or TMPFILE since this
      might be insecure (thanks to Topi Miettinen for the help!)
    [1 new tag]

  * Improved `copyright-file' to issue a special error message if a
    symbolic link /usr/doc/foo refers to a directory outside of /usr/doc
    (thanks to Darren for pointing this out!)
    [1 new tag]

  * Fixed `fields' check:
    - added architecture `arm' (thanks to Roman Hodek)

  * Fixed `lintian' frontend:
    - run lintian scripts with LC_ALL=C
      (thanks to Yann for pointing this out! fixes:bug#19166)
    - changed handling of `#' comments: for comments in the overrides
      file, the hash (#) has to be in the first column
    - changed all tags which used `#' for comments

  * Fixed `lintian-info':
    - multiple HTML tags haven't been converted into text format in all
      cases
    - preformatted text is now handled correctly
    - merged with code that produced the HTML reports
    - code much cleaner now

  * Improved Lintian's documentation:
    - fixed libtool/rpath workaround file: don't wrap long line
      (Thanks to Yann for pointing this out!)
    - stress in docs that the "lintian-maint@debian.org" address should
      be used to contact the lintian authors (thanks to Adrian Bridgett
      for pointing this out!)

  * Added more overrides (fixes:bug#19163)

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Mar 1998 23:00:31 +0100

lintian (0.3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added `scripts' checks and collector, written by Richard. This check
    checks the #! lines of scripts in a package.
    [40 new tags]

  * Added `spelling' checks, written by Richard. This check searches
    the "Description:" field and the "copyright" file for common spelling
    errors (typos).
    [2 new tags]

  * Improved `files' check: No package should install files directly into
    /usr/share.
    New tag:
      file-directly-in-usr-share

  * Fixed `files' check WRT files in /usr/lib/sgml and
    /etc/emacs/site-start.d:
      -	ignore directories and symbolic links when checking for correct
        file permissions
      - display permissions in octal format
    (fixes:bug#18866,#19026)

  * Fixed `control-files' check: really ignore `control' control file

  * Improved `lintian' frontend:
      - parse command line parameters before reading the configuration
        file. With that, `lintian -h' even works if the cfg file has
        errors.  (fixes:bug#19031)
      - issue a warning and ignore `-all' option if packages are specified
        at the same time (in older versions, this make lintian abort with
        an error message)
      - really check all packages listed in a .changes file
        (fixes:bug#18851)

  * Fixed `md5sums' check to handle file names with spaces correctly

  * Put conffile /etc/lintianrc back in (fixes:bug#19031)

  * Include information about libtool/rpath workaround by Yann Dirson
    (Thanks Yann!)

  * Added more overrides

  * Internal changes:
      - Each error tag has a (bug) `Severity' field now which can be used
        to file bug reports with the correct severity
      - Each helper script has an `Author' field now
      - Fixed `unused overrides' report

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Sat,  7 Mar 1998 18:46:31 +0100

lintian (0.3.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Lintian now also works without a configuration file and without
    a static laboratory!  (Since Lintian is so easy to use now, there
    are no excuses for not using it! ;-)

  * Changed handling of lab:
      - if no lab is specified, it is created dynamically by the
        `lintian' command (the average use does not have to worry
        about the lab anymore)
      - since the dynamically created lab is placed in /tmp, several
        users can run lintian at the same time without having to know
        of each other
      - the commands `lintian-setup' and `lintian-remove' have been
        removed (fixes: bug#18707).
      - a `static' laboratory can be created/updated or removed by
        specifying the `--setup-lab' or `--remove-lab' options for the
        `lintian' command
      - added a lot of sanity checks to make removal of lab less risky :)

  * Changed handling of configuration file:
      - configuration file is not necessary anymore
      - changed search path for the configuration file to:
          $LINTIAN_CFG/lintianrc
          $LINTIAN_ROOT/lintianrc
          $HOME/.lintianrc
          /etc/lintianrc
      - all configuration variables have reasonable defaults and can
        be overwritten by environment variables of the same name
      - removed configuration file /etc/lintianrc--the file is now
        installed as /usr/doc/lintian/lintianrc.example
      - renamed all configuration variables to LINTIAN_xxxx
      - relaxed syntax of configuration file. It's now also possible
        to use `~' and `$HOME' in the configuration file (fixes:
        bug#18559)
      - added LINTIAN_ARCH configuration variable so that Lintian
        handles distribution directories correctly if these contain
        several architectures

  * Changed parsing of command line arguments:
      - if a package name is specified (instead of a file), look for
        this package in the distribution directory and in the lab (in
        earlier version, only the distribution directory was searched
        for packages)
      - added `--all' option to check the whole distribution
        (in earlier version, this was the default operation)
      - removed buggy `-n' command line option (this option wasn't
        really useful anyways)
      - the `-h' option displays a short description of all available
        options now
      - debug option `-d' can be specified several times to increase
        the verbosity level
      - recognize `--' as the end of options on the command line

  * Improved overrides handling:
      - the override files does not include the leading `[EW]:'
        anymore
      - the parameters of an error tag may be omitted to disable
        a certain tag for a whole package
      - when checking the full distribution, unused overrides are
        displayed
      - cleaned up overrides file and added/removed a few overrides

  * Improved documentation:
      - there is now a `Lintian User's Manual' which explains how to
        setup and use Lintian to check ones packages, and which gives
        insight on the design issues behind Lintian
      - added a manual page for lintian-info (has been split off
        from lintian(1))
      - updated the documentation files and the example lintianrc file
      - merged QUICKSTART file into the README

  * Improved `binaries' check: check if a binary or shared library
    defines RPATH
    (Thanks to Ray Dassen for the suggestion! fixes: bug#18519)
    New tag:
      binary-or-shlib-defines-rpath

  * Improved `files' check:
     WRT symbolic links:
      - issue errors instead of warnings
      - links between different top-level directories should always be
        absolute
      - check for relative links which contain to many `../' segments
      - check for symbolic links which contain segments like `foo/../bar'
        (Thanks to Manoj for the patch and the ideas!)
     general:
      - some additional checks for wrong file permissions
    New tags:
      symlink-has-too-many-up-segments
      relative-symlink-enters-same-toplevel-directory
      symlink-contains-up-and-down-segments
      bad-permissions-for-etc-cron.d-script (renamed)
      bad-permissions-for-etc-emacs-script
      executable-in-usr-lib-sgml

  * Fixed `control-files' check: check file permissions correctly;
    also check file owners of control files
    New tag:
      control-file-has-bad-owner

  * Fixed `copyright' check: check for package dependencies correctly
    (fixes: bug#18611)

  * Improved `conffiles' check: files in /var/lib/games should not be
    tagged as conffile, in general.
    New tag:
      score-file-may-not-be-conffile

  * Improved `manpages' check: files in /usr/X11R6/man/man6 usually
    indicate X11 games in the wrong directory.
    New tag:
      x11-games-should-be-in-usr-games

  * Fixed `init.d' check: skip comments in init.d file
    (Thanks to Joey for pointing this out!)

      - don't collect info for unselected collector scripts (internal bug)

  * Internal changes:
      - don't refer to package `ftp.debian.org' for bugs in the
        $LINTIAN_DIST directory--refer to package `general' instead
      - made list-binpkg and list-srcpkg more verbose
      - made lintian-info less verbose (don't give detailed info more
        than once)
      - create control-index file which lists all files in control.tar.gz
      - fix permissions in the lab after a package has been unpacked
      - chdir to lab dir before running the checker and collection
        scripts (this makes it easier to write checks in awk or even sh)
      - pass vars to helpers via environment
      - don't link static info/* files into lab
      - implemented dpkg_read_control to parse all controls
      - don't use dpkg-deb to get control information about a .deb
      - collection and checking scripts `registry' is now done dynamically
      - move tag descriptions from collector and checker scripts into
        separate `.desc' files
      - each base directory in the lab has a .lintian-status file now, which
        can be used to detect incompatible lab changes, for example
      - moved unused files and internal documents into a private/ directory
        of the source package
      - cleaned up code

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Sun,  1 Mar 1998 23:16:15 +0100

lintian (0.2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added `fields' check for control fields. (That's the first check
    written by Richard--and it's all Perl!!! ;-)
    [32 new tags]

  * Added `binaries' check.
    [6 new tags]

  * Improved `shared-libraries' check:
      - use objdump instead of ldd and ldconfig
      - this should fix all problems where Lintian couldn't check
        python/perl dynamic objects, etc.
      - allow cross-checking of packages, e.g., to check non-i386 .debs
        on an i386 system (note, that this requires a multi-arch objdump)
      - recognize if the shared library uses its SONAME
    New tag:
      shared-library-uses-its-soname

  * Improved `control-files' check:
      - Don't check the `control' control file for correct
        permissions, because dpkg doesn't care and this file isn't
        installed on the systems anyways

  * Improved `files' check:
      - Games are allowed to be setgid games
      - svgalib programs are allowed to be setuid root
      - usually, files in /usr/doc/foo should not be executable
    New tag:
      executable-in-usr-doc

  * Fix bug in `manpages' check: symlinks in /usr/bin, etc. also need
    a manual page! (Thanks to Joey Hess for pointing this out!)

  * Use `.' instead of `source' in lintian-{remove,setup} /bin/sh scripts
    (fixes bug#18421)

  * Define default values for configuration variables in
    lintian-{remove,setup} scripts (fixes bug#18354)

  * Fix bug in `copyright-file' check: Don't report
    usr-doc-symlink-to-foreign-package if we don't know whether the
    referenced package comes from the same source or not.
    (Thanks to James A. Treacy for pointing this out!)

  * Internal change:
      - process source packages before binary packages so that a binary
        package check can use info from the source packages (if these
        are unpacked, too)

  * Added more override entries--and removed a few obsolete entries
    (the checks are smarter now! :)

  * Added "Depends: binutils" for `objdump'

  * Changed maintainer email address to lintian-maint@debian.org

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Sat, 21 Feb 1998 22:39:46 +0100

lintian (0.2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed manual-pages check: Check for the `undocumented' symbolic
    link failed on X11 manual pages (fixes #18343).

  * Improved files check. New tag:
      etc-cron.d-script-tagged-executable

  * Improved control-files check:
      - the `du' control file is not allowed anymore
      - check file permissions of control files
    New tags:
      control-file-has-bad-permissions

  * Fixed bug: ldd-info collection script stopped when ldd failed

  * Fixed (internal) bugs:
      - collect data for collection scripts too
      - don't collect init.d data every time again

  * Error handling code improved again :)

  * The lintian frontend script checks if it has root permissions and
    aborts if this is the case. (Running it as root is unnecessary and
    simply too dangerous.)

  * Added one override entry

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Feb 1998 21:50:16 +0100

lintian (0.2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bug in lintian-setup: don't try to create $LAB if it already
    exists (fixes bug#18227, bug#18252)

  * Added "Depends: file" (oops!)

  * Rewrote package "Description:"

  * Added a lot more override entries (thanks to all that told me about
    overrides!)

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Feb 1998 12:55:58 +0100

lintian (0.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bug in ldconfig collection script: script aborted without
    error message if a shared library had errors (thanks to Kai!)

  * Fixed bug: `standards-version' check didn't collect necessary data
    (actually, this was a more general bug--thanks to Joey Hess!)

  * Fixed bug: init.d checker script didn't notice if several of the
    required options (start, stop, etc.) have been included on a single
    line (thanks to Joey Hess!)

  * Don't check duplicated packages more than once (thanks to Joey Hess!)

  * Error handling code improved once more

  * Added more overrides (Thanks to Joey Hess!)

  * Mentioned Lintian's home page in the README file

  * Set package priority to `optional' (requested by several developers)

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Feb 1998 11:44:32 +0100

lintian (0.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * First public release

  * Fixed bug in shlibs check: Sometimes, ldconfig doesn't install any
    symbolic links at all (e.g., for `acroread' package).

  * Changed lintian-setup: Don't remove the whole lab if it already
    exists--just remove the info/ directory.

  * Changed handling of critical Lintian errors (abort on error)

  * Built package using fakeroot (first time i tried fakeroot--it's great!!)

  * Checked package with latest Lintian :)

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Sat, 14 Feb 1998 21:49:10 +0100

lintian (0.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Next beta release (hopefully the last one :-)

  * The lintian-info script is available now! You can either pipe the output
    of lintian through it, or specify the `-i' option when calling lintian.

  * Lintian can check .changes files now! New tags:
      bad-distribution-in-changes-file
      file-size-mismatch-in-changes-file
      md5sum-mismatch-in-changes-file
      bad-section-in-changes-file

  * Lintian now detects if packages have been changed, even if they
    have the same version number as before.

  * Improved shlibs check (this fixes the "error: bad ldconfig-info file"
    bug). New tags:
      ldconfig-symlink-referencing-wrong-file
      ldconfig-symlink-is-not-a-symlink

  * Improved files check! New tags:
      package-installs-into-etc-rc.d
      non-standard-file-permissions-for-etc-init.d-script

  * New check for /etc/init.d scripts! Tags:
      duplicate-updaterc.d-calls-in-postinst
