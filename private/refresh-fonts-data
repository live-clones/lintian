If <contents> is specified, it should be the path to the Contents file
from the current unstable distribution.  It will be used to find all
font files already packaged for Debian and update the list of known
font files and the packages that contain them.  <path-to-data> should
be the path to the root of the Lintian data directory to update.

If the Contents file is not specified, the script will download the
following files from a mirror.  The mirror can be specified with the
DEB_MIRROR environment variable.  If it is not set, the default is
http://deb.debian.org/debian.

* Contents-i386.gz

Any necessary special parameters for wget can be set via the
environment variable WGET_ARGS.  The default arguments are -nv.
