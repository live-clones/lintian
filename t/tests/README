WRITING A TEST
==============

A test in this framework is a directory containing a desc file, providing
metadata about the test, and other files used to build the test package.

Naming conventions
------------------

Each test name should begin with the name of the part tested, e.g.

<checkname>-...
<unpackname>-...
lintian-...
lintian-info-...

Use generic- as a prefix for test cases that don't cover a specific
portion of Lintian but instead test Lintian's behavior on a useful special
case of package (such as a generic dh-make template).

Sequence numbers
----------------

Each test should have a sequence number to get a more deterministic order.
You do not need to use unique numbers, only enough to make the order
deterministic and to your liking!  You should use the middle of the
assigned range as default number and only divert from it if you have a
reason to.

Number ranges:

0000 - 0999	Basic test, that generally just assure that the test
		suite and lintian are not completly broken
1000 - 1999	Tests for lib/       [1500]
2000 - 2999	Tests for frontend/  [2500]
3000 - 3999	Tests for unpack/    [3500]
4000 - 4999	Tests for collection/[4500]
5000 - 6999	Tests for checks/    [6000]
7000 - 8999	<unused>
9000 - 9999	Tests for reporting/ [9500]

The desc file
-------------

The desc file is formatted like a Debian control file.  The required
fields are:

    Testname: <should match the directory name>
    Sequence: <sequence number>
    Version: <version number of package>
    Description: <description of the purpose of the test>

In addition, the tags (if any) that the test case is testing for should be
listed in a Test-For key.  The tags that the test case is testing are not
issued (checking againts false positives) should be listed in a
Test-Against key.  In both cases, the tags should be separated by
whitespace.  The following format is suggested for multiple tags:

    Test-For:
     lintian-tag-1
     lintian-tag-2

with the tags listed in alphabetical order.

The default lintian command-line options are -I -E.  You can change these
options with an Options field specifying the lintian options to use.  This
overrides the default, so add -I -E if you want to include those options.
For example, to test --show-overrides with the -T option, use:

    Options: --show-overrides -T no-copyright-file

The string TESTSET in the Options field will be replaced with the root of
the test suite (the whole test suite, not the test currently running) so
that the Lintian options can refer to files in the test suite directory to
test options like --suppress-tags-from-file.

By default, the Lintian output is sorted before comparing it to the tags
file.  To suppress the sort (when, for instance, checking non-standard
output formats), use:

    Sort: no

By default, all tests are built as native Debian packages.  To build
the test case as a non-native package, add:

    Type: non-native

to the .desc file.  You will also want to change the version number to
be non-native unless you're testing a mismatch.

By default all tests are run with the default Lintian profile.  If a
different profile is needed it can be specified via:

    Profile: test/profile

The value will be passed to Lintian via the --profile parameter.

There are times when one wants to add a test for something that needs
to be done.  To mark it as such, preventing the test suite from
failing, use:

    Todo: yes

Test cases marked as Todo will suceed if they fail _the testing step_
and fail if they suceed.  Although this option can be very useful to
document what needs to be done, the ideal situation is to have none of
them :)

Unless you're writing a test case just to improve Lintian's test coverage,
you will normally want to add a References field giving the source of the
test or the bug that you're testing for.  This should be one of "Debian
Bug#nnnn" for a bug report, a URL into the debian-lint-maint mailing list
archives, or a message ID for the message to the list.

By default, templates/skel and templates/skel.upstream are used as the
test skeleton and then the files in the specific test directory are
overlaid.  To start from a different skeleton, use:

    Skeleton: <skeleton to start from>

The value must match a directory name in the t/templates directory.  If
this is a non-native package, there must also be a corresponding
<skeleton>.upstream directory.

Sometimes tests requires certain packages that are not available in the
current stable.  In this case, you can use:

    Test-Depends: <dpkg depends field>

If any of the dependencies are unavailable, the test will be skipped.

All other fields in the .desc file are optional and control the values
filled into the template control and changelog files by the test suite
harness.  The following additional fields are currently supported:

    Date: <date for changelog entry>
    Author: <maintainer for control and changelog>
    Architecture: <architecture for control>
    Section: <section for package>
    Standards-Version: <standard version for control>

See t/runtests and t/templates/skel/{control,changelog}.in for how
they're used.

The test directory
------------------

The test directory should contain the following files and directories:

debian
    The file tree forming the unpacked package.  This directory should
    normally have a debian subdirectory containing any files that are
    different than the template unless exactly the default template
    values are used.  The skeleton will be copied to the build
    directory for the package and then the contents of this directory
    will be copied over top of it.

upstream
    For a non-native package, this is the file tree that goes into the
    upstream tarball.  The files here should also be present with the
    same contents in the debian directory unless you're intentionally
    creating a diff.  However, as normal with a Debian package, you
    can omit files entirely from the debian directory and the
    deletions will be ignored by dpkg-buildpackage.

tags
    The expected output of Lintian when run on the package, including
    info and experimental tags.  The Lintian output will be
    lexicographically sorted before comparing it with tags.  This file
    may be empty if the test case should produce no Lintian output.

pre_upstream
    If present and executable, this script is run for a non-native test
    type after preparing the upstream directory but before creating the
    tarball.  It receives the path to the package directory as its first
    argument and can make any modifications that can't easily be
    represented in the template system (such as creating files that
    shouldn't be stored in a revision control system).

pre_build
    If present and executable, this script is run after preparing the
    upstream tarball (if any) and the package directory, but before
    running dpkg-buildpackage or lintian.  It receives the path to the
    package directory as its first argument and can make any
    modifications that can't otherwise be represented in the template
    system (such as deleting files from the template that aren't
    desired).

post_test
    If present, assumed to be a sed script that is run on the output
    of Lintian before comparing it to the tags file.  The most common
    use for this script is to remove the architecture from tags
    produced on the .changes file with a line like:

        s/_[^ _]* changes/_arch changes/

    but it may be useful for other cases where the output of Lintian
    may change on different systems.

test_calibration
    If present and executable, this script is run after the Lintian
    output has been generated and after post_test (if present).  The
    script can be used to calibrate the expected output or actual
    output.

    It is useful for cases the expected output is architecture
    dependent beyond what the post_test script can handle.

    The script will be passed 3 arguments, the "expected output" file,
    the "actual output" file and file name to write the "calibrated
    expected output".  The script may modify the "actual output" file
    and create the calibration file, which (if it is created) will
    be used instead of the original "expected output" file.


Be aware that Git doesn't track directories, only files, so any
directory must contain at least one file to exist in a fresh Git
checkout.  Test cases that just use the template must therefore still
have some file in the debian directory.  Normally, this is handled by
creating a small README file; see t/tests/basic for an example.


RUNNING THE TEST SUITE
======================

The complete test suite will be run with debian/rules runtests, but
this can take quite a lot of time.  Normally this is only necessary
after significant structural changes or before a release as a final
check.

To run a specific test case, run:

    debian/rules runtests onlyrun=<desc-name>

You can omit the .desc from the end of <desc-name>.  Give only the
file name, not the full path.

It's often more useful to run every test that is relevant to a
particular tag.  To do that, run:

    debian/rules check-tag tag=<tag>

This will run all tests that list that tag in either Test-For or
Test-Against.


TEST WRITING TIPS
=================

Please keep each test case focused.  One of the problems that
developed with the old test suite is that each test was serving many
separate purposes and testing large swaths of Lintian, which made it
difficult to know what could be changed and what would destroy some
other useful test.  Test cases should only test a set of closely
related tags and new tests should be added for new issues that aren't
part of that closely-related set.

Test cases should be as Lintian-clean as possible except for the tags
that they're testing for.  The template is intended to help with this.
It generates a Lintian-clean basic package for you to start with.  You
should override only the minimal required to trigger your test, and
try to fix any unrelated problems.  Sometimes this won't be possible
and the only way to trigger a tag is to also trigger another tag, and
that's fine, but it shouldn't be the normal case.

Test cases should only be listed in Test-For or Test-Against if
they're a target of that test case.  Tags that are triggered as a side
effect of setting up the desired test case should not be listed, since
later changes or reworkings may cause those tags to no longer be
issued.

Be sure to use Test-For and Test-Against for tags that are targets of
a particular test case.  The test harness will ensure that the test
case behaves correctly, and that metadata is used for the check-tag
target and when checking test coverage.

The test template uses debhelper 7.  Use debhelper 7 features whenever
possible rather than replacing the rules file with a more verbose one.
In other words, if you want to skip a particular debhelper program, do
something like:

    %:
            dh $@

    binary: binary-arch binary-indep
    binary-arch:
    binary-indep:
            dh binary-indep --before dh_install
            dh binary-indep --after dh_install

rather than adding in all of the traditional targets.  All you have to
do is make dpkg-buildpackage happy (which means that in practice you
could just override binary, not binary-arch and binary-indep, but
doing it this way may provide some future-proofing).

Tests will generally fall into one of four basic types:

1. Tests for a specific tag.  To keep the overall size (and therefore
   run time) of the test suite down, consider combining a test for a
   new tag into a general test (see below) if it's just another simple
   addition that's very similar to what's being checked by another
   test.  However, be sure to keep all test cases tightly focused and
   err on the side of creating new tests.

2. Tests against a specific tag, generally as regression tests for
   false positives.

3. General tests of a set of closely-related tags.  For example,
   there's no need to create a test case for every weird file in a
   Debian package that files checks for; one test case that installs a
   lot of weird files can easily test multiple tags at once without
   any confusion.  Similarly, there's no need to create a separate
   test case for every type of cruft that could exist in a source
   package; one test case could contain, for instance, metadata files
   for every major VCS.  Conventionally, these test case names often
   end in -general.

4. Generic test cases that provide an interesting representative of a
   type of package and thereby test a lot of tags (possibly from
   multiple checks scripts) that trigger on that type of package.  For
   example, see generic-dh-make-2008 (the results of running dh_make
   on an empty source package) or generic-empty (a package missing
   everything that dpkg-buildpackage will let one get away with
   missing).

If you by any reason need to write an architecture-specific test case,
make sure the target architectures are properly listed _in the desc
file_.  runtests will in then handle this special test correctly.
