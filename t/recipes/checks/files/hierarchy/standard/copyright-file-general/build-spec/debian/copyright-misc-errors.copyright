The path /usr/share/common-licences/GPL contains a spelling error.

It's wrong to reference a compressed license, like this:
/usr/share/common-licenses/BSD.gz

This path /usr/share/doc/copyright is obsolete.

The path /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL2 is missing a hyphen.

This copyright info was automatically extracted from the perl module.
It may not be accurate, so you better check the module sources
if you don't want to get into legal troubles.

References to /usr/share/common-licenses/BSD are deprecated.
