Description: [% $description %]
 This is a test package designed to exercise some feature or tag of
 Lintian.  It is part of the Lintian test suite and may do very odd
 things.  It should not be installed like a regular package.  It may
 be an empty package.
 .
 Note there is an explicitly pre-depends on multiarch-support, since
 older versions of debhelper might not use it yet.  dpkg-dev will
 remove the duplicate entry (if any).
