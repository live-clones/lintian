This is a test README.Debian with a few problems that Lintian should
catch, like accidentaly misspelled words.

Here is a reference to /usr/doc/debian-readme-general, which is an old
path that nothing should use any more.

ALS is not a spelling error for also and ANG is not a spelling error for
and.  In general, possible acronyms like COMIT should be ignored.  But
only to a certain length; CHNAGES is still wrong.
