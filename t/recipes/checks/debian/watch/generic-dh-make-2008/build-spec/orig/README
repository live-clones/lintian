dh_make 0.46 test
=================

This is the results of running dh_make 0.46 on an upstream tarball
containing only this file.  It's a useful test for the various dh_make
template and boilerplate tags, as well as many tags for ways of doing
things dh_make used to promote but are now deprecated or old debhelper
commands that are now deprecated.

Please don't modify anything about the files in this package; instead, add
new tags as needed when Lintian adds new checks.  This test case is
intended to continue to be a test of Lintian's handling of old and
template packages.
