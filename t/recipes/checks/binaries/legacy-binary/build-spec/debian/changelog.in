binary ([% $version %]) [% $distribution %]; urgency=low

  * I'm doing an comaintainer-upload, acknowledging a NMU, but with a version
    number which suggests I'm doing a NMU myself.

    Lintian-maintainers: Please don't update this changelog, otherwise you'll
    probably break the checks/nmu checks.

binary (4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Weird version number for the new check for accidents with native
    packaging.
  * Date was fixed by BR and this test was put on changelog-file-strange-date
    due to dpkg bug, see #794674.
