.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
This man page was abbreviated for the Lintian test suite.
.sp
\fBmount.cifs\fP mounts a CIFS or SMB3 filesystem from Linux. It is
usually invoked indirectly by the mount(8) command when using the "\-t cifs"
option. This command only works in Linux, and the kernel must support
the cifs filesystem. The SMB3 protocol is the successor to the CIFS (SMB)
protocol and is supported by most Windows servers, Azure (cloud storage),
Macs and many other commercial servers and Network Attached Storage
appliances as well as by the popular Open Source server Samba.

Linux kernel source tree may contain additional options and
information.
